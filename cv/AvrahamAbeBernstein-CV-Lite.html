<h2>1. Summary</h2>
<p>Senior software architect and polymath with over 40 years of innovation in algorithm design,
compiler construction, and obfuscation tools across industries including cybersecurity,
automotive, accessibility, and bioinformatics. Adept at designing domain-specific languages,
anti-reverse engineering, and building MVPs and prototypes for CTO teams. Holds multiple patents
and thrives on technically challenging projects.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE for pedantic HR types:</strong> This CV is unusual. And not primarily because
it is 7 pages long instead of 3, OMG! It represents my 40+ years experience as a polymath in a
wide range of domains at an expert level, and includes many inventions, many of which are
recent. First, in spite of my recent inventions, my long experience is a clear sign to HR that
my "shelf life has expired". Second, normally my inventions in such a wide range of domains
require a few lines of explanation in order to show their signficance, <em>especially for
someone who is not a domain expert</em>. Therefore this CV is quite different than someone's who
has been working in the same field using the same tools for 10-15 years without producing any
inventions, where a 2 page CV would suffice. When am I able to present my CV directly to a
colleague or a potential employer with a strong technical background, I have never encountered
even a single one who was not extremely impressed by my professional accomplishments, nor who
gave me any negative feedback on account of its length. And I am 69, which means it will be more
likely for me to be hired as a contractor or a consultant, instead of as a regular employee.</p>

<p><strong>2025:</strong> Independent: Founder &amp; Principal Engineer Compiler &amp;

</ul>
<p><strong>2022-25:</strong> <a href="https://www.auroralabs.com/">Aurora Labs</a>, Tel Aviv:
Senior Software Architect in CTO office for Digital Automotive Industry</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Invented a patent-pending</strong> algorithm to reduce RAM usage and boost
compression during FLASH updates. The key to the patent was the use of buffered I/O windows,
similar to the <em>Linux</em> file system, which eliminated the need to allocate a pre-image in
RAM the size of the FLASH sector especially when the size of the <em>DMA</em> write region is
typically only 256 bytes. Thus we are able to transfer larger FLASH chunks which typically
results in significantly better compression. For small FLASH devices, in the range of 64-128 KB,
compression could often be improved by up to 25%. And the board's original FLASH driver could be
utilized without any modification.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced CPU (<strong>6x</strong>) and RAM (<strong>2x</strong>) usage compared to the
company's original core source code refactoring product for embedded automotive C code via the
use of <a href="https://www.srcml.org/">srcML</a> and <a
href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a>. The original
version was a hand coded compiler in <em>Python</em>. Its purpose was to automatically reduce
the time of an automobile software update (via naive <em>LZMA</em> compression) from a few hours
to as low as 15 minutes. I had a great deal of co-operation from the company's chief scientist,
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmit-sahar/">Carmit Sahar</a>, who designed the original
version.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2021:</strong> <a href="https://www.morphisec.com/">Morphisec</a>, Beer Sheva:
Anti-Reverse Engineering Modifications to <em>Linux</em> <em>x64</em> Libc Kernel</p>
<ul>
<li>The challenges were (1) not to change the addresses of any of the <em>libc</em> functions,
and (2) to automatically modify the kernels of the many different <em>Linux</em> distributions.
Implementation was via the <em>Python</em> version of the <a
href="https://github.com/zyantific/zydis">ZyDis</a> <em>x64</em> disassembler.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2021:</strong> <a href="https://qed-it.com/">Qedit</a>, Tel Aviv: WASM Cybersecurity
Consultant for Financial Industry</p>
<p><strong>2017-20:</strong> <em>Argus Cyber Security</em> (now <a
href="https://plaxidityx.com/">PlaxidityX</a>), Tel Aviv: Senior Researcher for Digital
Automotive Industry</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Patented</strong> a modification to the <a
href="https://github.com/thoughtpolice/minibsdiff">mini-bsdiff</a> algorithm in order to
minimize FLASH memory usage in automotive software updates for devices which ostensibly did not
have sufficient FLASH to implement the algorithm. I was in contact with <a
href="https://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/">Colin Percival</a>, the original inventor of the
<em>bsdiff</em> algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Architect of embedded software update driver using <a
href="https://github.com/thoughtpolice/minibsdiff">mini-bsdiff</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XZ_Utils">xz</a> compression.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Earlier Roles (Selected)</h2>
<p><strong>2013-17:</strong> <a href="https://www.viaccess-orca.com/">Viaccess-Orca</a>
(subsidiary of Orange FR), Ra'anana: Cybersecurity Obfuscation Manager for Internet TV
industry</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invented</strong> <em>Linux</em> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_linker">dynamic share object (DSO)</a> export
masking of smartphone client S/W to make reverse engineering much more difficult.</li>
<li>Anomaly detection on content servers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2015 part-time:</strong> <a href="https://canarymission.org/">Canary Mission</a>,
Jerusalem: Internet Security "Hygiene" Consultant</p>
<p><strong>2013 part-time:</strong> <em>NVT</em>, US (defunct): CTO of Agritech Startup for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava">Cassava</a> Production in Nigerian Jungle</p>
<p><strong>2012:</strong> <em>Telequest</em>, Jerusalem: VP R&amp;D, Automated Vehicle
Navigation To Find Optimal Routes in City Traffic</p>
<p><strong>2011:</strong> <a href="https://www.syntezza.com/">Syntezza Bioscience</a>,
Jerusalem: Bioinformatics consultant</p>
<ul>
<li>In just 3 months I <strong>invented</strong> an AI threshold algorithm for <a
href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction-Fact-Sheet">PCR</a>
<a
href="https://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center/real-time-pcr-basics/real-time-pcr-understanding-ct.html">Ct</a>
detection, and a powerful and simple noise-reduction technique for a <a
href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-mrsa">MRSA</a> diagnostic
kit. When I first began work, their kit was a complete failure. Even though I had zero
background in microbiology, I discovered that the PCR control test tubes were configured
improperly in all of their 800 hospital samples, for which I was able to correct after-the-fact
even though the samples were long ago destroyed. And I discovered that their preliminary
chemistry was not able to filter the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">inhibitors</a> in
their nasal samples.</li>
<li>Even after correcting for the systematic noise (which the classic analysis could never had
detected due to huge level of inhibition), at least 50+% of the data points were inhibited, so
the graphs of the assays were definitely not <em>sigmoidal</em> (i.e. flat "S" shaped). Their
graphs looked more like <em>Rorchach</em> ink blots. And the graphs of the pure <em>MRSA</em>
colonies were linear, also definitely not <em>sigmoidal</em>. The fundamental assumption of
<em>PCR</em> mathematics is that the shape of the assay function must be <em>sigmoidal</em>, so
it seemed that we faced a catastropic failure. But my threshold algorithm handled them just
fine. I was mentored by the company's consultant, <a
href="https://independent.academia.edu/TzachiBar">Tzachi Bar</a>, who invented the most commonly
used public domain algorithm used in most <em>PCR</em> devices. <strong>My algorithm saved the
company's business unit from bankruptcy, and my algorithm won a MRSA detector "shoot-out"
against the big pharma labs at the world famous St. George's medical school in
London.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2005-10:</strong> <em>NDS</em> (now <a
href="https://www.synamedia.com/">Synamedia</a>), Jerusalem: Internet TV Industry:</p>
<p>1) Cybersecurity Research:</p>
<ul>
<li>I showed how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital
Rights Management (DRM)</a> protection schemes that relied upon date or playback count
restrictions could easily be broken by garden variety <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machines</a>.</li>
<li>I showed how the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU">QEMU virtual machine</a>, that
allowed for assembly instructions to be emulated <em>or modified!</em>, could be used to break
the host machine's random number generator (<em>without changing the application's binary
code!</em>), which allowed multiple confederate hosts to generate the exact same card ID, which
enabled massive leeching of content from the content servers.</li>
<li>I penetrated a confederate network of card ID sharing, and showed how all the confederates
could easily be knocked out.</li>
</ul>
<p>2) Satellite Content Servers Automated Testing:</p>
<ul>
<li>I <strong>invented</strong> a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language (DSL)</a>
(implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> on <em>Windows NT</em>) for
simulation of the satellite.</li>
<li>I used the <em>DSL</em> to generate flaws in the satellite's control program that disabled
the satellite.</li>
<li>I supplied the <em>DSL</em> to all developers to run sanity tests <em>before</em> checking
in their code.</li>
<li>I studied the company's bug database, and found that half of their development effort was
spent fixing bugs. The company had over 1000 developers! So I created a simple development
protocol that knocked out over half of the bugs on the developer's desktop <em>before</em>
submitting code to the QA group. The problem was that most check-ins were from make files with
tens of thousands of warnings. The silver bullet was insisting upon check ins of make files
without any warnings.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2002-03:</strong> <em>Virtouch</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): VP R&amp;D, Accessibility
Technology</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invented</strong> an <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a> web browser based solution
enabling the blind to interpret images, maps, and mathematical functions via the PC's (or
smartphone's) built-in sound card and a consumer grade graphics tablet.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1999-2004:</strong> <em>Vyyo</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): for RF wireless cable modem
industry</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manager offline software tools: <a
href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-management-system">network
management system (NMS)</a>, embedded <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/">SNMP
agent</a>, highly efficient <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/">ARP
table</a> and embedded <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/hash-table-data-structure/">hash table algorithm</a>,
and much more efficient modem speed testing via a <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/fibonacci-search/">Fibonacci search</a> algorithm
instead of the industry standard binary search algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Architect of super-efficient cable modem testing laboratory. Reduced H/W costs by a
factor of <strong>16x</strong> via multiplexing with a <a
href="https://www.automationdirect.com/adc/overview/catalog/communications/industrial_ethernet_switches/layer_2_managed_switches">programmable
layer-2 switch</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Invented</strong> a hybrid Ethernet/Dial-up network protocol for cable modems,
via dynamic modifications to the <a
href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/edge-router">edge router's</a> <a
href="%5BARP%20table%5D(https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ethical-hacking/how-address-resolution-protocol-arp-works/)">ARP
table</a> where the <em>edge-router</em> was the interface to both the dial-up and cable modem
Ethernet networks.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1998:</strong> <em>Fourfold</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): Software architect of a
modified GCC massively parallel compiler tool chain for a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>-like CPU with
unlimited registers.</p>
<p><strong>1990-97:</strong> <em>Pitkha</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): CEO &amp; Domain Specific
Language (DSL) Architect</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>1996-97:</strong> 2D <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/9/9/7021">conoscopic
holographic laser metrology</a> device for <a
href="https://www.ophiropt.com/en/">Optimet-Ophir</a> (subsidiary of MKS-Newport, US),
Jerusalem</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invented</strong> a <em>DSL</em> (implemented in the <em>Windows NT</em>
implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a>) used to scan objects
mounted on a XY jig. Due to lighting conditions on the object, different regions required
different scanning speeds.</li>
<li>In theory, a scan returned a cloud of tens of millions of XYZ points. The most difficult
problem was the creation of an easy to use language that generated life-like images from these
points. Note that this project was implemented before the mature <a href="https://vtk.org/">VTK
image visualization toolkit</a> became available. I <strong>invented</strong> my own, but
simpler, version of <em>VTK</em> based upon a <em>TCL</em> wrapper for <a
href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>1996:</strong> mil-spec testing laboratory for <em>Elop</em> (subsidiary of <a
href="https://www.elbitsystems.com/">Elbit</a>), Rehovot</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invented</strong> a <em>DSL</em>, a <em>BASIC</em>-like language (implemented in C
using <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~debray/Teaching/CSc453/DOCS/tutorial-large.pdf">lex
and yacc</a> before <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> became available in
<em>Windows NT</em>), that was used to reduce 2 meters of mil-spec testing documentation for the
<em>Black Hawk</em> weapons targeting system into a <em>manageable and easily modifiable</em>
set of requirements. The <em>DSL</em> had to support various H/W drivers for the test equipment
used in the lab. The <em>DSL</em> language was simple enough to use that the system engineer,
who had no programming background, could create <em>ad hoc</em> tests. Tests could run
unattended for up to 100 hours without any memory leaks.</li>

<li><p><strong>1992-95:</strong> <strong>Invented</strong> a <em>DSL</em> (implemented in C
using <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~debray/Teaching/CSc453/DOCS/tutorial-large.pdf">lex
and yacc</a> ) that was the backbone for a software development tool chain for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP_Group">DSPG</a> <a
href="https://www.edn.com/dsp-group-pinedspcore/">PINE</a> CPU:</p>
<ul>
<li>The tool chain included a clock accurate CPU simulator, debugger with a programmable I/O
port simulator (BTW still, in 2025, not yet found on most debuggers or emulators), assembler,
disassembler, and overlay linker. (Note that this project was implemented before the stable
version GCC 2.95 became available). Initially the purpose of the <em>DSL</em> was to resolve the
problem of register usage restrictions between adjacent assembly instructions. The VLSI
architects regularly changed the restrictions which made it extremely difficult to create a hand
crafted assembler in a reasonable period of time. A register restriction violation required the
manual insertion of a <em>NOP</em> into the instruction stream. (Today, i.e. 2025, modern CPU
architectures can automatically "stall" the pipeline).</li>
<li>The <em>DSL</em> implemented a language that completely described the CPU's instruction set.
Changes to the register restrictions were trivial to implement, and the assembler could be
recompiled within an hour. <strong>The assembler ran over 100x faster than the VLSI simulated
assembler. The assembler ran for over 100 hours without any memory leaks. The assembler allowed
the architects to regularly run instruction set sanity tests as soon as the architecture was
updated. The complete tool chain was used by application programmers to build and test complete
applications 6 months before the final production of the physical CPU.</strong></li>

<p><strong>1990-91:</strong> <strong>Invented</strong> a <em>DSL</em> to completely automate a
metal blade production factory at <a
href="https://www.iscar.com/index.aspx/countryid/1/lang/en">Iscar</a>-Matkash, Tefen</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plant included the following types of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>various types of workstations with multiple stands where pallets for parts and raw materials
were placed, and from where the end product was removed</li>
<li>automatically guided robotic vehicles delivered pallets to and from the workstation
stands</li>
<li>some pallets were transported by conveyor, and others placed on stacks</li>
<li>the storage region had room for hundreds of pallet stands</li>
<li>work-in-progress parts that were stored for too long had to oiled in order to prevent
rust</li>
<li>tools that required maintenance, e.g. cutting tools, recorded their consumption before being
sent for repair (e.g. sharpening)</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My job along with my co-architect, <a href="https://www.sifutaichi.com/">David
Goldstein</a>, was to automatically orchestrate the plant via S/W. We had a (then) powerful
<em>VAX/VMS</em> computer at our disposal with a relational database. The project manager
insisted that the main programming language be <em>Pascal</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We came to the project with no knowledge of factory automation. So we started with a
month long mentoring course from an industrial engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>Our solution was to design a <em>DSL</em> that described every single object (i.e. a few
100) in the factory's "object kingdom", and how they interacted with one another. The
<em>DSL</em> had to configurable by the factory engineer who was not a software engineer, while
the clerical staff required a GUI window into the DSL for making on-the-fly configurations and
viewing the status of the factory.</p></li>
<li><p>It became immediately obvious that the S/W required object oriented techniques to
implement. At that time <em>object oriented programming (OOP)</em> was in its infancy, and
barely used in industry. There was no Internet yet at that time, but literature was available in
the Hebrew Univ computer science library. Recall that we had a hard requirement to use the
procedural Pascal language.</p></li>
<li><p><em>VAX/VMS</em> had a command line utility for designing command "ensembles" which could
be executed via callbacks to a compilable language, e.g. Pascal. We used these ensembles to
define every type of object, along with their attributes, supported by the our DSL. Today, i.e.
2025, I would use <em>XML</em> instead (which had not yet been invented).</p></li>
<li><p>There were tens of thousands object instances stored in a database on disk - including
their configuration and current status. The database regularly stored status updates. The
database was constantly scanned in order to implement the next task that our scheduler required.
In the event that the main computer shut down, either expectedly or unexpectedly, the database
allowed for a smooth restart/recovery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After about a year, we implemented a working factory!</strong></p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Early 3D printing (stereo-lithography) R&amp;D.</p></li>
<li><p>PC accessibility <strong>invention</strong> for quadriplegics: Invention of virtual
keyboard using a telescopically modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen">CRT
light pen</a>, which could support a 800 mm. distance from display, combined with a <a
href="https://orin.com/access/sip_puff/">sip and puff switch</a>. Our first subject was a
quadriplegic polio victim, with the light pen connected to her head via a women's hairband, who
could type 30 characters per minute, and who productively worked as a book editor. The virtual
keyboard could be configured so that only a single selected key was displayed on the screen,
where the light pen hovered, which allowed over 95% of the screen to remain unobstructed. Too
bad I didn't patent this virtual keyboard invention.</p></li>
