<h2>4. Earlier Roles (Selected)</h2>
<p><strong>2013-17:</strong> <a href="https://www.viaccess-orca.com/">Viaccess-Orca</a>
(subsidiary of Orange FR), Ra'anana: Cybersecurity Obfuscation Manager for Internet TV
industry</p>
<p><strong>2013 part-time:</strong> <em>NVT</em>, US (defunct): CTO of Agritech Startup for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassava">Cassava</a> Production in Nigerian Jungle</p>
<p><strong>2012:</strong> <em>Telequest</em>, Jerusalem: VP R&amp;D, Vehicle Navigation</p>
<ul>
<li>Developed traffic jam reduction algorithms for automotive navigation, an early (failed)
competitor to <a href="https://www.waze.com/apps">Waze</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2011:</strong> <a href="https://www.syntezza.com/">Syntezza Bioscience</a>,
Jerusalem: Bioinformatics consultant</p>
<ul>
<li>In just 3 months I invented an AI-driven <a
href="https://www.genome.gov/about-genomics/fact-sheets/Polymerase-Chain-Reaction-Fact-Sheet">PCR</a>
threshold algorithm and noise-reduction techniques for a <a
href="https://www.webmd.com/skin-problems-and-treatments/understanding-mrsa">MRSA</a> diagnostic
kit. When I first began work with this company, their kit was a complete failure. Even though I
had zero background in micro-biology, I discovered that the PCR "control" test tubes were
configured improperly in all of their 800 hospital samples, for which I able to correct
after-the-fact even though the samples were long destroyed. And I discovered that their
preliminary chemistry was not able to filter the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">inhibitors</a> in
their nasal samples. I invented a new extremely accurate algorithm for "Ct" detection in spite
of 50+% of inhibited data points, and which worked on pure MRSA colonies, both of which resulted
in non-sigmoidal shaped graphs of the underlying biological assays which was the fundamental
assumption of industry standard PCR algorithms. The algorithm won a MRSA detector "shoot-out"
against the big pharma labs at the world famous St. George's medical school in London.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2005-10:</strong> <em>NDS</em> (now <a
href="https://www.synamedia.com/">Synamedia</a>), Jerusalem: Cybersecurity Researcher for
Internet TV industry</p>
<p><strong>2002-03:</strong> <em>Virtouch</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): VP R&amp;D, Accessibility
Technology</p>
<ul>
<li>Invented web browser-based solution enabling the blind to interpret images and maps via a
graphics tablet and sound card.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1999-2004:</strong> <em>Vyyo</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): for RF wireless cable modem
industry</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Manager offline software tools: <a
href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/network-management-system">network
management system (NMS)</a>, embedded <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/simple-network-management-protocol-snmp/">SNMP
agent</a>, highly efficient <a

<li><p>Architect of super-efficient cable modem testing laboratory. Reduced H/W costs by a
factor of 16x via multiplexing with a <em>programmable</em> layer-2 switch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1998:</strong> <em>Fourfold</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): Software architect of modified
GCC massively parallel compiler toolchain for a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">Forth</a>-like CPU with
unlimited registers.</p>
<p><strong>1990-97:</strong> <em>Pitkha</em>, Jerusalem (defunct): CEO &amp; Domain Specific
Language (DSL) Architect</p>
<p>Invented Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) for:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>1996-97:</strong> 2D <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/9/9/7021">conoscopic
holographic laser metrology</a> device for <a
href="https://www.ophiropt.com/en/">Optimet-Ophir</a> (subsidiary of MKS-Newport US),
Jerusalem</p>
<ul>
<li>The DSL (implemented in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a>) was used to
scan objects mounted on a XY jig. Due to lighting conditions on the object, different regions
required different pre-defined scanning speeds.</li>
<li>In theory a scan returned a cloud of tens of millions of XYZ points. The most difficult
problem was the creation of an easy to use language that generated life-like images from these
points. Note that this project was implemented before the mature <a href="https://vtk.org/">VTK
image visualization toolkit</a> became available. I invented my own, but simpler, version of
<em>VTK</em> based upon a <em>TCL</em> wrapper for <a
href="https://www.opengl.org/">OpenGL</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>1996:</strong> mil-spec testing laboratory for Elop (subsidiary of <a
href="https://www.elbitsystems.com/">Elbit</a>), Rehovot</p>
<ul>
<li>The DSL, a BASIC-like language (implemented in C using lex and yacc before <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> became commonly available) was used to reduce 2
meters of mil-spec testing documentation for the Black Hawk weapons targeting system into a
manageable, <em>and easily modifiable</em>, set of requirements. The DSL language was simple
enough to use that the system engineer, who had no programming background, could create <em>ad
hoc</em> tests. Tests could run unattended for up to 100 hours without any memory leaks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>1992-95:</strong> completely automated factory for <a
href="https://www.iscar.com/index.aspx/countryid/1/lang/en">Iscar</a>-Matkash, Tefen</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The plant included the following types of objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>various types of workstations that had multiple stands where parts and raw materials were
placed, and the end product was removed</li>
<li>robotic arms automatically inserted parts and raw materials into the station, and removed
the end product</li>
<li>robotic automatically guided vehicles delivered and removed pallets from the workstations to
the correct stand, and moved them to the conveyor system or to the storage area</li>
<li>some pallets were transported by conveyor</li>
<li>some pallets were placed on stacks</li>
<li>pallets were temporarily stored in a storage area made up of hundreds of stands</li>
<li>work-in-progress parts that were stored for too long had to oiled in order to prevent
rust</li>
<li>tools that required maintenance, e.g. cutting tools, recorded their consumption before being
sent for repair (e.g. sharpening)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My job along with my co-architect was to automatically orchestrate the plant via S/W. We
had a (then) powerful VAX/VMS computer at our disposal with a relational database. Our liaison
from DEC insisted that the main programming language be Pascal.</p></li>
<li><p>We came to the project with no knowledge of factory automation. So we started with month
long mentoring from an industrial engineer who did.</p></li>
<li><p>Our solution was to design a domain specific language (DSL) that described every single
object (i.e. a few hundred 100) in the factory's "object kingdom", and how they interacted with
one another. The DSL had to configurable by the factory engineer who was not a software
engineer, while the clerical staff required a GUI window into the DSL for making on-the-fly
configurations and viewing the status of the factory.</p></li>
<li><p>It became immediately obvious that the S/W required object oriented techniques to
implement. At that time object oriented programming (OOP) was just being developed in
research/university settings. The first version of C++ was just released, and SNOBOL was an OOP
research prototype. There was no Internet yet at that time, but literature was available in the
Hebrew Univ computer science library. Recall that we had a hard requirement to use the
procedural Pascal language.</p></li>
<li><p>VAX/VMS had a command line utility for designing command "ensembles" which could be
executed via callbacks to a compilable language, e.g. Pascal. We used these ensembles to define
every type of object, along with their attributes, supported by the our DSL. Today (2025), 30
years later, I would use XML instead (which had not yet been invented).</p></li>
<li><p>There were tens of thousands object instances stored in a database on disk - including
their configuration and current status. The database regularly stored status updates. The
database was constantly scanned in order to implement the next task that our scheduler required.
In the event that the main computer shut down, either expectedly or unexpectedly, the database
allowed for a smooth restart/recovery.</p></li>
<li><p>After about a year, we implemented a working factory!</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>1990-92:</strong> The DSL (implemented in C using lex and yacc) was the backbone
for a software development toolchain for the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP_Group">DSPG</a> <a
href="https://www.edn.com/dsp-group-pinedspcore/">PINE</a> CPU:</p>
<ul>
<li>The toolchain included a CPU simulator, debugger with a programmable I/O port simulator (BTW
still, in 2025, not found on most debuggers or emulators), assembler, disassembler, and overlay
linker. (Note that this project was implemented before the stable GCC 2.95 became available).
Initially the purpose of the DSL solved the problem of the registry usage restrictions between
adjacent assembly instructions that the VLSI architects changed regularly which made it
extremely difficult to create a hand crafted assembler in a reasonable period of time. A
restriction violation required the manual insertion of a NOP into the instruction stream.</li>
<li>The DSL implemented a language that completely described the CPU's instruction set. Changes
to the restrictions were trivial to implement, and the assembler could be recompiled within an
hour. The assembler ran over 100x faster than the VLSI simulated assembler. The assembler ran
for over 100 hours without any memory leaks. The assembler allowed the architects to regularly
run instruction set sanity tests as soon as the architecture was updated. The complete toolchain
was used by application programmers to build and test complete applications 6 months before the
final production of the physical CPU.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>1988-89:</strong> <em>Cubital</em> (subsidiary of <a
href="https://www.company-histories.com/Scitex-Corporation-Ltd-Company-History.html">Scitex</a>
), Herzliya:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Early 3D printing (stereo-lithography) R&amp;D.</p></li>
<li><p>PC accessibility invention for quadriplegics: Invention of virtual keyboard using a
telescopically modified <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen">CRT light pen</a>, 800
mm. distance from display, combined with a <a href="https://orin.com/access/sip_puff/">sip and
puff switch</a>. Enabled a quadriplegic polio victim, with the light pen connected to her head
via a women's hairband, to type 30 characters per minute to become a book editor. The virtual
keyboard could be configured so that only a single selected key was displayed on the screen,
where the light pen hovered, which allowed over 95% of the screen to remain unobstructed. Too
bad I didn't patent this virtual keyboard invention.</p></li>
