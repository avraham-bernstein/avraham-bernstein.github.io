<h2>Introduction: Cr8tive Solutions To Hard Problems</h2>
<ol>
<li>I have more than 40 years experience in state-of-the-art software development especially
inventing new algorithms.</li>
<li>I have many inventions and some <strong>recent patents</strong> in a wide variety of
application domains, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>digital automotive industry</li>
<li>Internet TV</li>
<li>cybersecurity and anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse

<li>accessibility</li>
<li>factory automation</li>
<li>VLSI CPU design</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am an <a href="https://simplicable.com/new/expert-generalist">expert generalist</a> and an

fields.</li>
<li>In order to jump start my learning process I prefer to find a domain expert to mentor me,
and I am also a good mentor myself.</li>
<li>I am a "hands-on" master software engineer. I enjoy programming. I design prototypes and
minimum viable products for <em>CTO</em> groups.</li>
<li>I know many computer languages which I am able to learn easily due to my <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> background; and my compiler
background allows me to design <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages
(DSL)</a> and to engage in automated <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">code refactoring</a>.</li>
<li>My "go to" <em>programming</em> languages in which I am quite proficient are the following:
<ul>
<li><em>C</em></li>
<li><em>Python</em> and <em>BeautifulSoup</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)">Jinaj2</a>, the "gold
standard" macro and template preprocessor</li>
<li><a href="https://pyexpander.sourceforge.io/">Pyexpander</a>, which is simpler than
<em>Jinja2</em> and just as useful except where inheritance is needed, <em>but</em>
unfortunately it is <em>polluted</em> by a <a

</ul></li>
<li>My "go to" <em>data</em> languages are <em>HTML</em>, <em>Markdown</em>, <a
href="https://www.pandoc.org">pandoc</a>, <a href="https://www.srcml.org">srcML</a>,
<em>XML</em>, <em>YAML</em>, and <em>Excel</em>.</li>
<li>I thrive on undertaking new challenging projects. I am quite comfortable engaging in and

Automotive Software Updates: Researcher in CTO office
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>The company's core product relied upon <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> the automotive client <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">OEM's</a> source code in
order to make it much more efficient to generate software updates. Sometimes their product could
reduce update times by a factor of 10 compared to the default technique of using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
(i.e. successor to <em>zip</em>) compression.</p></li>
<li><p>I invented an extremely efficient technique to greatly improve the efficiency of their
initial refactoring software by combining the <a href="https://www.srcml.org/">SRCML</a>
compiler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> output in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> format with the Python <a
href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a> library in order to
generate the refactored source code.</p></li>
<li><p>And I invented a technique (US patent pending) to greatly reduce RAM usage when the
embedded software generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">FLASH</a> files
by modifying the internals of the ubiquitous <em>C</em> <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memcpy.3.html">memcpy</a> function by
incorporating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">Posix</a>-like buffered I/O when
memcpy is used to sequentially write to FLASH. The RAM savings enables usage of larger "chunks"
that enables higher compression ratios for legacy system boards with small amounts of RAM, e.g.
less than 256 KB. Sometimes compression ratios could be improved by 25%.</p></li>

Server Cybersecurity: Reverse engineering X64 object code
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I reverse engineered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">X64</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code">object code</a> of the <em>Linux</em> kernel
module <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/libc.7.html">libc</a> in order to modify
the internals of the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html">exec
functions</a>, where these functions are used in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow">stack smashing</a> attacks, <em>but
without changing the addresses of any of the libc exports</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inserting the extra security functionality into these functions necessitated a slight
increase in their sizes, therefore it was quite challenging not to change the addresses of any
of the other <em>libc</em> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>I implemented the project in <em>Python</em> using the <a
href="https://zydis.re">Zydis</a> disassembler <em>Python</em> library.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that every X64 Linux release and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distro</a> will likely have a slightly
different libc object code implementation.</p></li>

Banking Cryptographic Algorithms: Securing C algorithms in a web browser using WASM
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I implemented <em>C</em> cryptography functions in <em>Javascript</em> web assembly (<a
href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>). _WASM_object code is much faster and much more
difficult to debug than <em>Javascript</em>. Because this project was intended for the banking
industry, in the future we could write a <em>WASM</em> <a

difficulty of debugging.</p></li>

Automotive Software Updates: Software researcher
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I architected and implemented a software design for efficient software updates of
embedded systems using mini-bsdiff delta encoding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the original bsdiff software is not designed for the size limitations of embedded
systems especially for legacy automotive boards.</li>
<li>In particular the original bsdiff software incorporates the outdated bz binary compressor
that has a 100 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li>Mini-bsdiff is not bundled with any binary compressor at all.</li>
<li>Mini-bsdiff can be combined with the modern xz binary compressor designed for embedded
systems that only has a 26 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li>It is not computationally feasible to generate an offline mini-bsdiff patch where at least
one of the source files is larger than 8MB, in which case it is preferable to use the
VCDiff/xdiff algorithm which is commonly used on web sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I invented <a
href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/069147491/publication/EP3680773A1?q=20150616.9">EU
Patent EP3680773A1</a>, a mini-bsdiff patch implementation for small FLASH memory systems where
the FLASH is not big enough to temporarily hold both the original version "A" and new version
"B" of the object code. Normally bsdiff requires both versions be available when applying the
patch.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with Google's Courgette improvement to bsdiff, but it required a
relatively large amount of RAM on the target device to support a linker. The large RAM is not
typically available on legacy boards used in the automotive industry. I developed an algorithm
that dispensed with the need for a linker.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with techniques for using source code patching instead of bsdiff object
patching. The Elektrobit management refused to believe that it was commercially feasible to have
access to an OEM's source code. I switched jobs to <a href="#aurora">Aurora Labs</a> above
because I believed that source code patching is a better solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I was the company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a>
"enforcer". While I understood the safety rationale and the legal requirements for <em>Misra
C</em>, I found many of their rules to be unnecessarily pedantic. I developed <a
href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a> preprocessing utilities that
worked around these pedantic rules, but that still generated valid <em>Misra C</em>
code.</p></li>

Internet TV Infrastructure: Cybersecurity obfuscation manager
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I focused on obfuscation, i.e. anti-reverse engineering, of their smartphone (i.e.
Android and iPhone) client player, by selecting a C/C++ obfuscating compiler and by building
home brew utilities. I selected the WhiteCryption compiler originally built by InterTrust and
acquired by Zimperium in 2021 after I left. When I first selected the product WhiteCryption was
still in the beta stage. I worked very closely with the WhiteCryption development team - mainly
specifying new features and testing existing ones. Previously I worked on an in-house
obfuscation compiler at NDS, which I considered far beyond the manpower resources we had at
Viaccess-Orca. After I left Viaccess, they switched to the French Quarkslab compiler partially
because Viaccess HQ is in France.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my most important utilities was designing an ELF Dynamic Share Object DSO (i.e. an
<code>so</code> file) which had no export table which ostensibly eliminates the usefulness of a
DSO. I designed a low-level mechanism to load an encrypted export table relying upon ELF's
special <code>init</code> section which executes before the DSO is activated. The export table
is one of the major attack surfaces in a DSO.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with the 3rd party software supplier of the video codec in order to
substantially bolster the security of their product which proved to be a major potential
security hole in our system. The challenge was that most of their customers did not require the
security that we did, and for practical commercial reasons they were not willing to make a
separate build for us. I managed to architect an optional security plugin for them that caused
minimal changes to their system, and caused zero interference to their other customers who chose
not to use the plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially the movie studios insisted that smartphones could not be rooted because it made
them considerable more difficult to debug, so I developed a fuzzy logic-like mechanism to detect
rootedness. The problem was that less expensive Android phones from Asia, that were flooding the
market, were rooted by default because it saved the manufacturer a few hours of licensing work
from Google who controlled AOSP (the Android Open Source Project). Therefore security had to be
moved from the client to the content servers. For example a license that license that played 100
hours of content a week was suspect, or a license that played content simultaneously from
different geographic locations was suspect.</p></li>

PCR MRSA Kit: Inventor of bioinformatic PCR algorithm</span>
</summary>
<p>The company's product was a novel <em>dry</em> test kit for <a
href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336">MRSA</a>
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> amplification device). <em>MRSA</em> is a
lethal strain of <em>staphylococcus</em> bacteria. It thrives in hospitals where it is the major
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis">iatrogenic</a> killer of immunologically
compromised patients. Therefore it is critically important that hospitals identify carriers
among both patients and hospital staff as soon as they are infected. Most people who are
infected with <em>MRSA</em> carry it in their nasal passages. Most interesting such a person,
even an immunologically compromised one, can still live until 120. However if an immunogically
comprised person touches his nose, and afterwards touches an open wound then he is in danger of
death. Prior to <em>PCR</em> technology, it took a laboratory about 48 hours to identify the
disease by growing a culture in a "gold standard" <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Petri dish</a>, but <em>PCR</em> technology can
make the identification within 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Before joining the company I had zero background in biology, micro-biology, genetics,
or biochemistry.</strong> When I arrived the company was in imminent danger of closing down
their <em>PCR</em> business unit because their initial <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> trials completely
failed that they had spent about $500K to prepare by taking 800 samples from a few Israeli
hospitals. The owner was "pulling his hair out" because he felt that his science was 100%
correct. First he hired <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tzachi-Bar">Tzachi Bar</a>
to consult, the inventor of PCR mathematical algorithms used in all PCR devices at that time
world wide, but <em>Bar</em> could not help him. I happened to be the owner's neighbor. He knew
that I was a computer scientist, so he took his final chance with me. <strong>Within 3 months I
made a number of discoveries that validated the owner's science and enabled them to pass the
<em>FDA</em> trials.</strong> In spite of my technical success, for commercial reasons beyond
the scope of my short article, they were forced to close down their <em>PCR</em> business unit;
therefore my <a href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">threshold
algorithm</a> was never patented.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Initially <em>Bar</em> and the company's chief microbiologist gave me a 2 week crash
course in the fields of microbiology and genetics that they felt I would need for my
work.</p></li>
<li><p>My first task was to generate amplified graphs of all 800 samples, and to study them.
Note that every sample had a <em>PCR</em> result, and an associated "gold standard" <em>Petri
dish</em> result.</p></li>
<li><p>My second task was to carefully read the manual of the <em>PCR</em> device. I noted that
the company's junior biochemist who was responsible for administering the hospital tests had
used an incorrect protocol for configuring the <em>PCR</em> devices. The 3 control samples that
every batch contains were placed in incorrect test tube slots. Therefore all test results were
nonsensical!</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the samples had been thrown away weeks before I arrived, fortunately they had
saved the raw data from the <em>PCR</em> devices, that allowed me to reconstruct the
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm. The new results were better, but still hardly good enough for
the <em>FDA</em> that required 80% accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>I noted that tests from the pure laboratory colonies of <em>MRSA</em>, with extremely
high concentrations never to be encountered in a patient sample, all failed. This indicated to
me that there was a flaw in the industry standard <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>And I noted that many tests with negative <em>PCR</em> results, in spite of the positive
Petri results, had random graphs instead of the smooth <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay">bioassay</a> sigmoidal shaped curve of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a> that
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> expected. After discussing the matter with <em>Bar</em> and the senior
biochemist, this indicated that the graphs were statistically noisy due to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a>.
Therefore the company's preliminary chemistry did not yet filter out nasal impurities that
mature chemistry was supposed to do. Maybe we had to "throw in the towel", i.e. to give
up?</p></li>
<li><p>So I put on my "thinking cap", and discovered a completely new algorithm that was much
better than the Bar-Tsichopad algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>I discovered a much more accurate and simple way to normalize the bioassay curve and to
remove systematic noise, by noting that the "systematic" noise and the linear rise in the signal
of the negative control sample precisely matched the patient samples (from the same batch).
Therefore my simple normalization solution was to subtract the negative control sample from the
patient samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <em>Bar</em> and the senior biochemist agreed with me that inhibition never
increases the <em>PCR</em> signal. Therefore I used an alternative <a
href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">AI threshold test</a>,
instead of the <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> test that was based upon advanced mathematical functional
analysis to calculate the <a
href="https://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center/real-time-pcr-basics/real-time-pcr-understanding-ct.html">Ct</a>
of the assay.</p></li>
<li><p>I split the patient samples in half. For the control half, I used the single maximum
signal from each sample. I recorded minimum PCR signal that indicated a positive Petri result.
And similarly I recorded the maximum PCR signal indicated a negative Petri result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I used the other half of the patient samples to test my new threshold algorithm.
My predictions were 95% accurate in spite of the high degree of inhibition found in the
preliminary chemistry!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The explanation for the minor inaccuracy was some results were in the "gray" region where
there was an overlap between the minimum PCR signal to indicate a positive result, and the
maximum PCR signal to indicate a negative result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>My threshold algorithm won a MRSA "shoot out" at the world famous UK <a
href="https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/">St Georges medical school hospital</a> against competing
PCR kits from the huge international pharmaceutical companies!</strong></p></li>

Internet TV Infrastructure: Cybersecurity software researcher
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>Most of my work at NDS was doing software security research including occasional code
security audits.</p></li>
<li><p>I was one of the first security researchers in the world to prove that the ubiquitous
virtual machine packages, e.g. VMWare and VirtualBox, could break simple DRM protection schemes
like date restrictions or replay count.</p></li>
<li><p>I showed how X64 virtualization hardware could be used together with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU">QEMU</a> to break the software random number generator
(RNG). This was a very critical attack because the fundamental security assumption was that each
client PC had a world wide unique cryptrographic "nonce". But if confederate clients could share
their nonces then a single license could be shared by all members of the confederacy. At that
time, c. 2007, the cycle counter instruction <code>RDTSC</code> was easily subverted by the
virtualization technology. After I left the company, since 2012 the CPU has a hardware RNG
instruction <code>RDRAND</code> which is a much safer instruction from the perspective of
security.</p></li>
<li><p>I invited outside security researchers to give lectures and seminars to in-house
developers on state-of-the-art security techniques. Based upon these lectures I developed an
obfuscated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>-like
compiler that was extremely difficult to reverse engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2007 NDS was invited by the Chinese government TV system to protect the 2008 Beijing
Olympics TV feed. I "almost" won the contract. The Chinese government did not want Microsoft to
be involved in the bidding because nearly 100% of servers and client PCs had stolen operating
system licenses which could easily be revealed when Microsoft installed the protection software.
At time the Olympic TV feed was owned by Microsoft company MSNBC. Eventually Microsoft agreed
not to sue China for the stolen operating system licenses, and they offered the protection
package for free so they won the contract.</p></li>
<li><p>The Israeli satellite TV operators had their feed stolen by Israeli expats in the US, and
more massively in the Palestinian areas. I showed how to it was possible to easily technically
stop these thefts. For reasons that are still not clear to me, the operators showed no interest
in stopping the thefts.</p></li>
<li><p>My first job at NDS was as a contractor. I built a tester and simulator for the NDS
satellite software. I designed a DSL (domain specific language) in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> to do this task. After my analysis of their
software, I concluded that there were critical flaws in the design. I was quite knowledgeable in
VAX/VMS O/S internals. The junior VP in charge of the project refused to believe that a mere QA
guy could have such knowledge, so I built a graduated test program that blew his (virtual)
satellite out of the sky. Afterwards my software was installed on every developer's desktop.
Before checking in software into their version control system, it became standard operating
procedure to run a 10 minute test prior to check-in.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with the QA department to analyze their bug reports, and concluded that nearly
50% of their software effort was bug fixes. And they had more than 1000 software developers! I
worked with the QA department in order to implement a program to greatly reduce bugs. I recall
that their biggest problem was lazy software builds that often contained tens of thousands of
warnings. My most important improvement was insisting on zero warnings, or adding explicit
compiler approval of any warning to be explicitly allowed.</p></li>

Broadband RF Networking: Architect of super-efficient cable modem testing laboratory

<ol>
<li><p>I designed an extremely efficient network testing laboratory.</p></li>
<li><p>By selecting 24-port programmable layer-2 switches for each of the PC's 4x100 MB Ethernet
ports, each PC was able to control 96 cable modems during low speed ping tests, whereas
previously each PC could only control 4 modems (i.e. one per Ethernet port), which resulted in
massive (24x) cost savings through the reduction of PCs and their associated electrical
infrastructure, floor space, and air conditioning.</p></li>
<li><p>For high speed testing at 8 MB per modem, each PC's Ethernet port could only support 12
modems; but the programmable switches could be dynamically configured to quickly open and close
ports.</p></li>
<li><p>I Implemented automated control of the lab in <a

<li><p>Instead of implementing speed tests with Cisco's network utilities which relied upon a
binary search algorithm, initially I wrote a program to implement a <a

significant improvement. Subsequently I wrote a <a

Blind Accessibility Device: Inventor and VP R&amp;D
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I invented a software system that allowed the blind to "see" and to understand computer
images, especially maps and mathematical functions, using a</p>
<p>a. standard PC or smartphone web browser</p>
<p>b. the device's builtin speaker</p>
<p>c. ideally a consumer grade graphics tablet and stylus (e.g. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Graphic-Drawing-Tablet-Beginners/dp/B07S1RR3FR">Wacom
Bamboo</a> ~$50)</p>
<p>d. although optionally, but less preferably, with the device's builtin mouse</p></li>
<li><p>The software heavily relied upon the builtin <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">standard vector graphics (SVG)</a> capability of all
modern web browsers (since 1999).</p>
<p>a. <em>SVG</em> is an <em>XML</em> variant.</p>
<p>b. <em>SVG</em> returns the postion and color at the cursor.</p>
<p>c. Unlike <em>JPG</em> or <em>PNG</em> pixelated images, <em>SVG</em> has the ability to
smoothly zoom in or zoom out of vector images.</p></li>
<li><p>The basic concept can be understood by using an example image of a circle.</p>
<p>a. Let the display be black, except for the perimeter of the circle which is a few pixels
wide and which is colored white.</p>
<p>b. In the simple case where the user's stylus hovers over a white pixel, a sound is played,
but hovering over a black pixel yields no sound.</p>
<p>c. Blind users prefer a graphics tablet to a mouse because blind users still have hand-eye
(or actually mind-eye) coordination, so they can easy navigate around the tablet. Mice have the
problem that the cursor gets stuck at the edge of the display when you scroll beyond the edge.
It is possible to provide sonic cues to ameliorate this problem, but using a tablet and stylus
is much easier.</p>
<p>d. Divide the screen into a grid of 96x96 rectangles, or equivalently 8x8 12-tone chromatic
octaves. Let the horizontal (x) axis be represented by a piano, and the vertical (y) axis be
represented by a flute. Instead of playing the same sound for all white pixel positions, play
the xy note combination in the grid position where the cursor is located.</p>
<p>e. If we would use two intersecting circles, say one white and blue, we could use different
instrument combinations to represent the colors, and/or we could use the keyboard or click on
the stylus to query which circle we are touching, where the application will provide a
text-to-speech response.</p></li>
<li><p>Images need to be prepared offline. But in the case of maps, most of which are already
designed using <em>XML</em>, it is possible to programmatically automate their
preparation.</p></li>

Fabless DSP CPU Design Center: Inventor and S/W architect of a DSL used to implement the
software tool chain for the PINE CPU
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>DSPG designed CPU micro-controllers that supported DSP functionality. When I joined them
they were working on their original PINE chip. They were a VLSI "fabless" design center. After
finishing their designs, they had them manufactured by a real "fab". At that time it could take
up to 6 months for the fab to manufacture the physical chip. And DSPG designed the application
software that ran on their chips. At that time they designed the hardware and software internals
for consumer telephone answering machines.</p></li>
<li><p>VLSI software simulations ran extremely slowly because they simulated the low level
transistor details of their circuitry.</p></li>
<li><p>My job was (1) to design a clock accurate simulator that would run about 100x faster than
the VLSI simulator, and (2) to supply an assembler and <em>C</em> compiler that could be used to
test software applications months before the fab manufactured the physical chip.</p></li>
<li><p>At that time QEMU did not yet exist, and the GCC tool chain was not yet mature, i.e. pre
2.95, so I had to design my own assembler, simulator, linker, compiler, and debugger.</p></li>
<li><p>The key to the success of this project was my design of a domain specific language (DSL)
to formally describe each one of the CPU's opcodes, and most important to recognize when an
instruction sequence would cause the pipeline to "stall". We built the DSL using lex and yacc.
At that time it was not yet common practice that CPU designers could automatically dynamically
insert delays into the instruction pipeline. It was the job of the application programmer (or
the compiler) to automatically insert these delays. My DSL included an easy to specify language
that detected stall conditions. Without this stall detection feature it was impossible for us to
develop the assembler in a timely fashion, because in the early stages of the design, the VLSI
architects made major change to the stall conditions almost daily. So our manually coded stall
conditions had to constantly be rewritten. Once we implemented this feature, we could generate
an updated assembler almost immediately, i.e. within a hour or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Another very important feature was that when debugging an application we could
programmatically simulate access to the I/O ports. Still 30 years later, i.e. 2025, this is not
a common feature of state of the art QEMU simulators.</p></li>
<li><p>The system worked as planned. Especially important is that application developers were
able to supply debugged applications months before the physical chip became available.</p></li>

PC Accessibility Device For Quadriplegics: Inventor and S/W architect
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>At that time, 1989, speech-to-text systems were not yet technically feasible or else
exorbitantly expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Our hardware solution was based upon attaching a telescopically enhanced <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pen">light pen</a> to a then ubiquitous <a
href="https://www.howtogeek.com/722863/what-is-a-crt-and-why-dont-we-use-them-anymore/">CRT</a>
display, where the light pen's select button was replaced with a <a
href="https://enablingdevices.com/product/sip-and-puff-switches/">sip-and-puff accessibility
switch</a>. Normally a light pen needed to be ~1 cm from the display, but with our military
grade optical enhancement it could be used ~80 cm away.</p></li>
<li><p>My initial software invention overlaid half of the display with a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_keyboard">virtual keyboard</a>, where the light pen
was used to select a key. The final solution used an "expert mode" where a virtual
<em>hidden</em> keyboard covered 100% of the display, but a key popped up only when the light
pen hovered over an individual key.</p></li>
<li><p>The first user of the device was <em>Shulamit Gabai</em> who was stricken with polio in
all of her limbs by the <em>Or Akiva</em> disaster where sewage leaked into the clean water
system. She was able to use the device to type 30 characters per minute, and thus was able to
become an editor for a book publisher.</p></li>
<li><p>For the new learning experience, I wrote the program in <em>Prolog</em>.</p></li>

High Speed Sewing Robot For Leather Goods: S/W architect of a DSL used to control the robot
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific
language (DSL)</a> annotates an <a
href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&amp;tab=subscription">Auto-CAD</a>
leather sewing pattern with "road signs". The signs are associated with sewing commands that
must be followed in real-time.</p></li>
<li><p>Since leather is a natural fabric, no pieces are identical with respect to size,
thickness, and color. An expert human sewing machine operator will take these differences into
account. Therefore the robot has a live video feed.</p></li>
<li><p>A high speed sewing robot can execute a few thousand stitches per minute. On account of
torque it takes a few seconds to change speed. Making mistakes may cause the machine to make
hundreds of unnecessary stitches which could seriously damage the (potentially expensive)
fabric.</p></li>
<li><p>Among other things the signs specify minimum and maximum speeds, the sizes of the minimum
and maximum overlapping regions, the pattern matching algorithm to be used depending upon the
texture and color of the leather, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>For example speed is a function of the angular changes, and the complexity of the of the
matching algorithm.</p></li>

Public Utility Commission: Public interest intervenor-economist at the ECAP77 hearings on
marginal cost pricing for electricity
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I was the first public interest <a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intervenor">intervenor</a> in the history of
the <em>OEB</em> to be awarded costs - at the suggestion of the <em>OEB</em>!</p></li>
<li><p>Due to intense political pressure from the mineral smelting industry who relied upon
subsidized electricity prices, the Ontario government forced the the public electric utility,
then called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hydro">Ontario Hydro</a>, to withdraw
their case after the hearings had already begun. I became the primary intervenor at the hearings
to present the case for <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/money/marginal-cost-pricing">marginal cost
pricing</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I published a full page op-ed about the hearings in Canada's then newspaper of record <a
href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I initially learned about the hearings from a course in my MBA program (1976) when I
complained to the Ontario Hydro economic team (beside the Univ campus) about the mediocre
<em>B</em> grade my professor gave me on my term paper.</p></li>
<li><p>I had legal standing because I paid an electric bill of about $25 a month!</p></li>
<li><p>This job was a formative learning experience for me that subsequently effected my whole
life because I learned that a single individual could effectively stand up to the corruption of
large business and government. With perfect hindsight, it was clearly a case of Divine
intervention (Hebrew: <em>Hashgacha Pratit</em>). Subsequently in Israel I became involved in <a

<em>successfully</em> stood my ground against government corruption.</p></li>

<p>Unlike CRC-32, the major flaw with Adler-32 is its lack of "spread" in the domain of
<code>sum</code>. Clearly short messages will have too small a spread, which results in many
collisions. However it is very easy to correct this problem by using a constant multiplier
<code>k</code> which is a function of <code>n</code>. We still retain the speed and simplicity
of the original algorithm. This algorithm is quite useful as an extremely fast
<em>non-cryptographic</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash

<h3 id="key-wrapper">2. Crypto: Lightweight Key Wrapper</h3>
<p>This algorithm wraps a 32-bit number with a 64-bit key and a pseudo-random 32-bit number; and
where the ALU can process 128-bit numbers then we can wrap a 64-bit number with a 128-bit key
and a pseudo-random 64-bit number. The random number can be generated on-the-fly in a local
random number generator. The algorithm is extremely fast. It is implemented in a few assembly
instructions. It can be executed <code>inline</code>. Therefore it is quite useful for
obfuscation.</p>

<h3 id="x-hamming-weight">3. Crypto: <em>Invertible</em> "Cross Hamming Weight"
Transformation</h3>
<p>Rotating a number by its Hamming weight is a cryptographically weak transformation because
(1) the transformation does not change the original Hamming weight, and (2) Hamming weights have
a binomial distribution where the weight has an extremely high probability of being in the
center of the distribution.</p>
<p>This simple invention improves these flaws. The transformation flattens the distribution by
(1) making the upper and lower half of the number into 2 adjacent <code>N/2</code>-bit binomial
distributions, and (2) 75% of the time it changes the original Hamming weight. And it is
possible to apply the transformation twice, where the result is 4 adjacent <code>N/4</code>-bit
binomial distributions.</p>
<p>The algorithm is implemented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The original number is split in half into its lower bits and upper bits. Both Hamming
weights are calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-complement-operator-tilde/">bit-wise
complemented</a> when the Hamming weight of the upper bits is <em>even</em> , while the upper
bits will be complemented when the Hamming weight of the lower bits is <em>odd</em>. Note that
the complement operation is invertible because it does not change parity.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be rotated by the original Hamming weight of the upper bits, and
<em>vice versa</em>. Similarly the rotation operation is invertible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern CPUs have a Hamming weight (aka <code>popcount</code>) instruction, therefore the
run-time overhead of using this transformation is negligible.</p>
<p>The transformation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">invertible</a>. After applying it to a
trivial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">LCG PRNG</a> which
is cryptographically very weak, the industry standard <a
href="https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/how-to-test-with-practrand.html">PractRand</a> analysis
shows the result to be as good as the highest quality PRNGs commonly used today. This
transformation is much stronger than the <a
href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/20325/do-data-dependent-rotations-have-any-advantage-over-fixed-rotations#20332">data

<h3 id="dynamic-flash-config-file">6. Embedded Systems: Dynamically Loadable FLASH Configuration
Files Larger Than RAM</h3>
<p>On embedded systems with limited RAM, it is not possible to load large configuration files
into RAM, and it is normally a security risk to parse the configuration file when dynamically
loading it regardless of its size. My invention allows the use of an off-line
<em>pre-parsed</em> configuration file into object data format <em>without any executable
code</em>. It can be dynamically loaded into FLASH memory at an address defined at load time
where (1) the system architect must have mapped the FLASH memory accordingly, (2) the <em>C</em>
structure of object file must be recognized by the control program, and (3) it is extremely
difficult (although not impossible) to modify the configuration for the duration of the
load.</p>
<p>The format can be designed to support variable sized memory regions in a way that can be
legally supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a> mandated
rules for safe programming design in industries such as automotive, aircraft, and medical
equipment, etc. Normally <em>Misra C</em> forbids the use of variable sized data structures. For
example, <em>Misra C</em> rules normally force developers to allocate space for sparse arrays,
so that an array of file names would require enough space in each array element to support the
longest possible file name. However my invention enables the array elements to be stored in a
packed heap in FLASH, so that each array element is a pointer into the heap.</p>
<p>I show how the off-line pre-parser can be implemented without any executable <em>C</em> code
by taking advantage of the GCC's <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html">designated initializer</a>
feature along with <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a>
preprocessing.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/aggregate_initialization">Designated

<h3 id="dyslexic-font">8. Accessibility: Generic Dyslexic Font</h3>
<p>I invented a scheme to modify existing fonts so that a dyslexic can easily read them by
mimicking the concept how computer vision programs can decipher <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> regardless of how they are rotated.
You should note that in QR codes there are 3 solid black squares in the top-left, top-right, and
bottom-left corners, but not in the bottom-right corner. My invention pads the the left and
right margins of each character in the font, allowing space for two vertical strips in each
margin. Each character will have the same size padding. In the middle of the inner left strip, I
add a diacritical dot. Now the dyslexic reader needs to follow a single rule, namely to note
that a validly oriented character has a dot in its inner left margin. The margins have to be
wide enough, so that the reader can recognize the spacing between a sequence of characters.</p>

<p>In the <em>Torah</em> in <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm">Gen. 18:19</a>
(Hebrew: <em>Parshat Vayeira</em>), <em>HaShem</em> (English: the Jewish name of God) states
that the reason why He chose <em>Avraham Avinu</em> (English: our forefather Abraham) and his
descendants to be His vanguard in this world is because "he [Avraham] will command his children
and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice"<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nechama_Leibowitz">Nechama Leibowitz</a>, the modern
biblical commentator <em>par excellance</em>, this is <em>HaShem</em>'s "prime directive" to the
Jewish People. I would like to believe that I have attempted to internalize this directive. My
attempts will be what my family and friends will remember me for, and hopefully emulate, but
hardly my contributions to computer science.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1995-96: I successfully fought the IDF eventually at the Supreme Court over their illegal
"Oslo" rules of engagement that would require that IDF soldiers not respond to Palestinian
threats at gunpoint, even from known terrorist murderers, until <strong>after</strong> the Pals
first fired at them!</p>
<details>
<p>a. In 1995 I initially received these orders at an <em>impromptu</em> visit in the field from
then Major General, <em>Ilan Biran</em>, where I vigorously argued with him. At the time I was a
corporal. The sycophantic general also said that he felt Oslo would usher in an era of peace
that would reduce the need for any IDF presence along the Jordanian border, at the exact same
time that the so-called "suicide" bus bombing campaign was in full swing in Israeli cities!
Afterwards I wrote the general an official letter of complaint to which his bureau responded
that I had "wax in my ears" in which they clarified why such an order <em>would have been</em>
patently illegal. A year later I received the exact same orders at a meeting of brigade officers
under the command of then Major General <em>Uzi Dyan</em>, <em>Biran's</em> successor. I
anticipated such an order, so I took the letter with me. When the brigade (Hebrew:
<em>Hativa</em>) commander, a colonel, started spewing his nonsense, I jumped up waving the
letter from his predecessor why his orders were patently illegal. His jaw dropped.</p>
<p>b. I had already prepared my petition to the Supreme Court which I instructed my attorney to
file that very same day. On the next day the army sent a brigadier general (Hebrew: <em>Tat
Aluf</em>) to interview me, a corporal, about my objections. The brigadier didn't deal with the
substance of my objections. Instead he claimed that I would cause WW III, and according to
script he threw me out of the army - for the the rest of my reserve duty that season. From home,
I immediately started to give interviews to the media. Soon I received a telephone call from my
regiment's (Hebrew: <em>Gdud</em>) sergeant major who sternly warned me that soldiers in uniform
were not permitted to speak with the media. When I reminded him that the army threw me out, he
burst out laughing.</p>
<p>c. Immediately the Attorney General (AG) responded <em>in camera</em> without my presence
before Justice <em>Tzvi Tal</em>, who was on administrative "gate keeper" duty (Hebrew:
<em>Shofet Toran</em>), that my petition was irrelevant and that I had no legal standing,
because the IDF had thrown me out. <em>Baruch HaShem</em> (English: thank God), <em>Tal</em>
ordered that my petition be heard within 10 days, referred to in Hebrew as a <em>Bagatz
Bazak</em>. The AG had the audacity not to provide me with his response until the moment I
arrived in the court room, when he then attempted to argue that on account of "military
secrecy", I did not have sufficient clearance to be allowed into the court room!</p>
<p>d. In the court room the AG and the IDF Adjutant General audaciously claimed that they never
issued any such order. (Note that such a bald lie in a legal deposition is normally a very
serious criminal offense, unless you happen to be the Attorney General). I brought affidavits
from other soldiers, and it was obvious that thousands of other soldiers who heard this
ridiculous order were seething too. The court agreed that such an order would be illegal, while
the court accepted the IDF's lame excuse that it would be inconceivable that such outrageously
illegal orders could ever have been issued by these illustrious generals. Is it surprising that
the senior judge on the panel who accepted this charade was none other than then Chief "Justice"
Aharon Barak who presided over this travesty of justice held "behind closed doors" under the
rubric of "military secrecy" in order to keep the IDF General Staff's depravity<a href="#fn5"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and sycophancy hidden from
the general public?</p>
</details></li>
<li><p>2017-20: I successfully fought the Ministry of Social Services at Jerusalem family court
over their attempt to force the adoption of the three young children of my wife's cousin, where
the Social Services' youth officer and their legal guardian, who the youth officer appointed,
were engaged in criminal malfeasance. They argued against giving the father custody because they
falsely accused him of sexually molesting one of his daughters, while the mother was mentally
unstable. I proved that they had perjured themselves when in fact they were aware that other
children had molested the girl on multiple occasions when she was held in locked-down youth
facilities administered by Social Services.</p>
<details>
<p>a. The key to winning the case was that I instructed the father to secretly record a
revealing conversation with the naive junior social worker who was responsible for the daily
care of his children in the institution. After receiving a stern warning following a visit from
the young girl's grandfather, a retired social worker from the US black ghettos where child
molestation was endemic, she felt obligated to install observation carmeras. She admitted to the
father that she caught the molester on camera, and that she was aware about the previous
molestation incidents in the other institution. And she described how when she brought the then
5 year-old girl to be treated by the institution's psychologist, he started treatment by using
the conventional technique of giving a male doll to the little girl in order for her to gently
describe what happened. Instead she astounded him by attempting to illustrate by pulling down
the zipper of the psychologist! Of course the psychologist, the legal guardian, and their boss -
the youth officer, denied everything. Unfortunately the family court judge regularly worked with
these professional colleagues; therefore he refused to have them indicted for perjury, but he
did eventually order that the children be released to the custody of their father primarily on
the basis of the recordings.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p>2022: I successfully fought the Ministry of Education over their attempt to force an
exceptionally bright autistic teenager to attend a school for emotionally retarded teens, or
else face truancy charges. They supplied him with a "confederate" aid who sabotaged him while in
the classroom, and abandoned him during COVID home schooling. I proved my case by having the
child evaluated at the world-renowned <a href="https://feuerstein-institute.org/">Feuerstein
Institute</a> who declared that he was indeed exceptionally bright.</p></li>
<li><p>2022: My wife and I took in a poor homeless Russian refugee family into our home for 4
months when the husband escaped from being drafted as cannon fodder into the Russian army's war
against Ukraine, months before they were finally recognized by the Israeli Absorption
Ministry.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>1993-96: In May 1993, 4 months before the declaration of the Oslo Accords on the White
House lawn, I helped to establish the leadership of the grass roots anti-Oslo campaign.</p>
<details>
<p>a. On the street in my neighborhood I befriended a leaker (who today still wishes to remain
anonymous) who worked in then Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin's office. The leaker
complained that he was ashamed of his work. He was preparing the groundwork for the Oslo
Accords. I convinced him to share his information with those who may be able to stop the
Accords. His legal "ground rules" for sharing were never to reveal any government documents in
order to have the cover of "plausible deniability". Therefore all the information that I shared
was obtained orally. In spite of lack of documentation, his <em>bona fides</em> soon became
clear. I published a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat">samizdat</a>, i.e. an
underground newsletter as this was before the era of the Internet. My main distribution point
was <a href="https://shorashimshop.com/blog/author/moshe/">Moshe Kempinski's</a> <a
href="https://shorashimshop.com/shop/">Shorashim Gift Shop</a> in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>b. I shared his information with <a href="https://womeningreen.org/about-us/">Ruth Matar
o.b.m.</a> founder of <em>Women In Green</em>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Elon">Rav Benny Alon o.b.m.</a> co-founder of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feiglin">Zu Artzenu</a>, and mainly with <a
href="https://davidmweinberg.com/2023/07/14/tribute-to-rabbi-sholom-gold-of-jerusalem-the-most-passionate-of-zionists/">Rav
Shalom Gold o.b.m.</a>, along with many others. I introduced him to <a
href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/steve-rodan/?anchor=about-me">Steve Rodan</a> then
diplomatic reporter for the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/">Jerusalem Post</a>. After
thoroughly investigating the leaker's claims, in December 1993 Rodan wrote an exposé in the
<em>Jerusalem Post</em> about the true intentions of the Accords, namely to unconditionally
grant Arafat a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> Palestinian state
regardless of the fraudulent obligations that Peres claimed Arafat agreed to undertake.
Unfortunately most of Rodan's professional colleagues considered him to be "off of his rocker".
He was forced to resign from the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>. It took almost 7 years for some to
finally issue a <a href="https://jewishworldreview.com/cols/tobin062200.asp">mea culpa</a>.</p>
<p>c. I received advice from <em>Yossi Ben-Aharon</em>, former Director General of the Prime
Minister's Office of <em>Yitzhak Shamir</em>, on "spy craft" in order to keep "under the radar".
I took on the <em>nom de guerre</em> "Avraham Yehuda", i.e. the full name given to me at my
<em>Brit Milah</em>. I acted as the leaker's secret spokesman to the press, to opposition
<em>MKs</em> (i.e. <em>Knesset</em> members), and to other influential people. Finally the
majority of sentient Jewish Israelis can now (2025) recognize that there was a direct line of
causality from the insanity and treachery of the Oslo Accords, to the so-called Gaza
"Disengagement", to the Shalit prisoner exchange, and finally to the Hamas massacre on Simchat
Torah 5784, i.e. on October 7 2023.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p>The majority of sentient Jewish Israelis can now (2025) accept my key takeaway from the
Oslo Accords, namely the architects of Oslo, Peres and Beilin, <em>designed it to fail</em>!</p>
<details>
<p>a. Peres had secretly promised the incorrigible arch-terrorist Arafat a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> state within a year knowing that he
would never adhere to the provisions of the Accords that they proudly presented to the Knesset
(comprised of Arabs, communists, and bribed Jewish members that still only gave them a razor
thin 61-59 majority) and to the gullible Israeli public (incited by the left wing news
media).</p>
<p>b. The <em>Knesset</em> was too slow in delivering Peres' promise, so Arafat began his
murderous tantrum to "convince" them to move faster - aka the second Intifada. Initially Arafat
attacked the so-called "settlers" who the leftist government abandoned. But they resisted and
refused to flee, in spite of the government's expectations to the contrary; so Arafat terrorized
Israel's soft underbelly, i.e. inside the "sacred" Green Line, in particular his "suicide" bus
bombing campaign.</p>
<p>c. The government had arranged the Baruch Goldstein massacre.<a href="#fn6"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Beilin fully expected that
it would lead to the expulsion of the Jewish community in Hevron, and thus break the settlers'
resistance, but the expulsion never happened because then PM Rabin was afraid of an army revolt,
so Arafat went berserk. No one alive at that time can ever forget how Peres referred to the
victims of Arafat's bus bombings as "sacrifices for peace" as the streets were literally flowing
with their blood, while he hysterically shrieked that "nothing could ever stop the peace
process" (because it was his road to amassing a fortune). A bus blew up in Jerusalem in front of
my son just before his wedding day. He entered the bus in order to try to save some of the
victims. He came home drenched in blood.</p>
<p>d. The leaker heard Beilin, brag to his confidants how he designed Oslo to be the perfect
diplomatic trap. He compared it to a runaway train. Beilin, with a doctorate in political
science, was aware that Western countries, and in particular the United States (at least until
the second Trump Administration), would never accept Israel canceling the Accords in spite of
the Pals' fundamental egregious breaches. (See the 2012 <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1XrXXyQX0A">Hebrew TV debate between Beilin and
Bennett</a>, just before former PM Naftali Bennett first entered the Knesset, where Beilin
lectures Bennett like a sophomore how it would be diplomatically impossible for future Israeli
governments to ever cancel the Oslo Accords). Up until now (2025) Beilin's predictions have been
100% correct for the past 30 years.</p>
</details></li>
<li><p>My most successful personal act against Oslo was preventing Arafat's May 1994 attempt to
ascend <em>Har HaBayit</em> (English: the Temple Mount). Arafat desperately wanted to
triumphantly ascend <em>Har HaBayit</em> just like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1187)">Saladin</a> did in 1187 CE.</p>
<details>
<p>a. Peres agreed, and it was Beilin's job to make it happen. I was in regular contact with
<em>Yaakov Novik</em> who organized the anti-Oslo demonstrations. We made sure that the police
were aware that Novik intended to stage a massive demonstration of hundreds of thousands to
prevent Arafat's ascent. The police were terrified that Jewish demonstrators would enter
<em>East Jerusalem</em> and directly confront Arab demonstrators, so the police nixed Beilin's
plan.</p>
<p>b. The leaker informed me that Beilin countered that he would schedule the ascent for
<em>Erev Shabbat</em> (English: Friday night) in the hope that the mostly religious Jewish
demonstrators would not show up. And the leaker said that Beilin secretly
<strong>ordered</strong> former Sephardi Chief Rabbi <em>Ovadiah Yosef</em> to issue a
<em>Halachic</em> (English: Jewish legal) decision that it would be <em>forbidden</em> for
Jewish demonstrators to show up because it would force the police to mobilize thousands of
policemen, many of whom were religious. <em>Yosef</em>, who at that time was the spiritual
leader of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shas">Shas</a> political party that was a
critical member Peres' coalition government, agreed because many <em>Shas</em> <em>MKs</em>
(i.e. <em>Knesset</em> members) were being blackmailed by the so-called "legal system" with
criminal indictments if they did not kowtow to government diktats. (Eventually when their
usefulness expired, many were indicted anyway including party leader <em>Aryeh Deri</em> who was
imprisoned for two years). I immediately informed former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi <em>Shlomo
Goren</em> of what his nemesis <em>Yosef</em> intended to do. <em>Goren</em> went berserk. He
issued a counter <em>Halachic</em> decision that it would be <em>obligatory</em> to violate
Shabbat to prevent the mass terrorist murderer Arafat from ascending <em>Har HaBayit</em>, so
Beilin and the police were forced to fold. As a consolation prize, Beilin arranged for Arafat to
secretly and ignobly ascend dressed as an old woman!</p>

<li id="fn1"><p><strong>Secure Photo:</strong> This secure photo was built using <a
href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> blurring filters (e.g. Gaussian, clothify, and oilify)
along with a prominent distorted visible email address watermark. This digital "camouflage" will
defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson
has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1)
Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be digitally
compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication
(2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying
my photo while attempting to associate it with any other person besides me. Similarly if a site
were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association with
them then it would be trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to challenge the
site by asking me for a verification email. And it would be interesting to consider adding an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation">Eurion</a> currency watermark that
would fool Photoshop software along with high quality printers and scanners into believing that
the watermarked photo is a banknote in order to prevent it from being manipulated or printed.
The general field of obscuring personal information is referred to as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification">de-identification</a>. There was an
Israeli company, <em>D-ID</em> now defunct, that specialized in obscurring high quality images
without using any blurring filters which could not be used in automated password verification
scanners!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p><strong>Autodidact Polymath:</strong> There is a common misconception that only
geniuses like <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> deserve the appellation autodidact polymath, and
therefore by referring to myself as one then I am making the bombastic claim to be a genius in
the same category as Leonardo. There is an outstanding <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGF3kjgCaMQ">TED talk</a> showing how children from Indian
slums with the appropriate mentoring can become <em>autodidact polymaths</em>. And there was a
similarly successful project done with children from <a
href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/free-thinkers/">Mexican slums</a>. Many very intelligent
people, especially as they get older, don’t like moving outside of their intellectual comfort
zone, whereas I revel in taking on intellectual challenges in new fields outside of my comfort
zone. Note my "grand slams" in a wide range of application domains, where the only way to
quickly achieve expertise was self-learning admittedly with the help of highly qualified
mentors. I feel that I still maintain a high degree of child-like <a
href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroplasticity">mental plasticity</a>. Part of
this skill I retain by regular interaction with my own young grandchildren, where my play with
them is much more analytical than I used to exhibit with my own children.<a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3"><p><strong>York Univ:</strong> Exceptionally I passed my comprehensive examinations
before I took any of the required economics courses! Therefore the school allowed me to take any
accredited courses from any Canadian university. I had initially wanted to take a graduate
degree in engineering from the Univ of Toronto but they refused to accept me as a
<em>regular</em> student, but they allowed me to enroll as a <em>special</em> student. In fact
most of my courses for the York degree were from the Univ of Toronto graduate school of
engineering.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p><strong>Chosen People:</strong> It is quite telling that that the biggest haters
of the Jewish People throughout history derive their hatred from this exact verse. What
infuriates them is that Jews are the conscience of the world, who recognize a higher Divine law
than <em>patently immoral</em> laws of dictators and kings, and even of elected governments
(e.g. Pharaoh, Haman, and Hitler). On the other hand, it is important to remember that
throughout history there have existed a few brave non-Jews who <a
href="https://rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation/shemot/on-not-obeying-immoral-orders/">feared
God</a> by defying patently immoral laws of their governments, e.g. the Egyptian midwives Shifra
and Puah in <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0201.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>, and modern day
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_Among_the_Nations">righteous gentiles</a> who
hid Jews from the Nazis at great risk to their own lives.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn5"><p><strong>IDF General Staff Depravity:</strong> (1) From the Oslo Accords to this
day (2025) it is accurate to describe the IDF General Staff as depraved. Generals are promoted
precisely because they are sycophants who have no interests in winning wars . (Reformed leftist
historian <a href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/404518">Dr. Gadi Taub</a> further
develops this theme). We saw this clearly in their criminal lack of preparation for the recent
October 7 Hamas massacres (e.g. <em>Yoav Gallant</em>, <em>Aharon Haliva</em>, and <em>Yaron
Finkelman</em>). We saw it in their denial that the so-called <em>Disengagement</em> would be an
existential disaster (e.g. <em>Shaul Mofaz</em>). We saw it in their lackluster execution of the
<em>Second Lebanese War</em> (e.g. <em>Dan Halutz</em>). On account of the IDF's generous early
retirement benefits, they view the IDF just as a stepping stone in their future career path
whether in politics or business, so they refrain from engaging in any politically incorrect
activities that might even prevent them from so much as taking a vacation with their wives for a
London shopping spree, because a UK court might indict them for "abusing the rights" of a poor
Palestinian. <em>Note that the spectacular initial response of the civilian reservists to the
October 7 massacres was very much in spite of the hysteria and lack of preparedness of the
General Staff.</em> (2) They are promoted because they subscribe to the pseudo ethical creed of
their <em>purity of arms</em> philosophy. Note that the fundamental flaw of their military
ethics guru <em>Asa Kasher</em>, who is worshiped by both the IDF and legal system, is that he
recognizes that our Islamic enemies also have a valid claim to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (English:
Land of Israel) even though they stated to immigrate here only since the 1880s. Therefore in his
opinion our wars are a "garden variety" fight over land. However it has finally (2025) become
painfully obvious to the majority of sentient Israeli Jews, including secular ones, that the
goal of our Islamic enemies is a religiously motivated <em>jihad</em> (English:
<em>annihilation</em>) of our Jewish presence here, exactly like the Nazis wanted to do to
European Jewry. Their claims about land rights are simply a pretext. Politically correct
leftists prefer to forget about the 1929 Arab massacres before there was a significant "Zionist"
presence here. Just listen to the regular Islamic rants from the Iranians. (Reformed leftist
political scientist and former Labor <em>MK</em> <a
href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/einatwilf_seven-arab-states-declare-war-in-an-attempt-ugcPost-7196581590959874049-1eHt">Einat
Wilf</a>, and in more detail <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOCCMaQ0rm0">here</a>,
further develops this theme). The enemy acts exactly like <a
href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3942715/jewish/Who-Were-Amalek-and-the-Amalekites.htm">Amalek</a>
did, and we must treat them accordingly. A Jewish society is fundamentally based upon the
principle of reciprocal ethics. Aside from the fact that <em>Torah</em> gives us these ethical
commands, logically a person should not steal from or murder his neighbor is because he does not
want his neighbor to do similar acts to him. However if our enemy hates us so much that his
primary reason for living is to murder us, and he has the wherewithal to do so, then we have a
<em>moral obligation</em> to kill him first.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn6"><p><strong>Baruch Goldstein Massacre:</strong> The politically correct Israeli
narrative is that Goldstein was a mass murderer. There were a large number of discrepancies in
the testimony that are too long to discuss here, and that <em>Justice Shamgar</em> admitted he
simply chose to ignore. Peres had a huge motive to expel the "settlers" in order to make good on
his promise to Arafat that he be given a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> Palestinian state because the
treaty that the <em>Knesset</em> and the people accepted did not call for such expulsions. As my
article clearly shows, the Oslo implementation was based on massive government lies - the most
egregious being the government's hiding of Arafat's responsibility for years of terrorism that
resulted in thousands of deaths. The judicial system "rubber stamped" all government decisions
that tread on "settler's" rights where the most egregious were stripping them of their gun
permits, and ten years later the Gush Katif <em>Disengagement</em> expulsion, and they "rubber
stamped" administrative detention of anti-Oslo activists that "magically" stopped as soon as
Bibi was first elected PM in 1996. There is no longer any <em>prima facie</em> reason to believe
in the objectivity of the Oslo judiciary. Therefore, I rely on the leaker's statement that
Goldstein was framed.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
