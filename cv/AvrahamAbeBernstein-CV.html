<h2 id="intro">Introduction: Cr8tive Solutions To Hard Problems</h2>
<ol>
<li>I have more than 40 years experience in state-of-the-art software development:
<ul>
<li>inventing new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithms</a></li>
<li>inventing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific
languages (DSL)</a> which can grossly simplify many difficult problem domains, especially for
non-programmers</li>
<li>using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> tools to automatically

anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscation</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am a "hands-on" master software engineer. I enjoy programming. I design prototypes and
minimum viable products for <em>CTO</em> groups.</li>
<li>I have many inventions and some <strong>recent patents</strong> in a wide variety of
application domains, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>digital automotive technology</li>
<li>Internet TV</li>
<li>cybersecurity</li>
<li>bioinformatics</li>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>factory automation</li>
<li>VLSI CPU design</li>
</ul></li>
<li>I am an <a href="https://simplicable.com/new/expert-generalist">expert generalist</a> and an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism">autodidact</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I easily learn and become an expert in new
fields.</li>
<li>In order to jump start my learning process I prefer to find a domain expert to mentor me,
and I am also a good mentor myself.</li>
<li>I know many computer languages which I am able to learn easily due to my <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> background.</li>
<li>My "go to" <em>programming</em> languages in which I am quite proficient are the following:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a> and <a
href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)">Jinja2</a>, the "gold
standard" macro and template preprocessor</li>
<li><a href="https://pyexpander.sourceforge.io/">Pyexpander</a>, which is much simpler to use
than <em>Jinja2</em> and just as useful <em>except</em> where template inheritance is needed,
<em>but</em> unfortunately is <em>polluted</em> by a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPLv3 license</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a>, including <a

</ul></li>
<li>My "go to" <em>data</em> languages are <em>HTML</em>, <em>Markdown</em>, <a
href="https://www.pandoc.org">pandoc</a>, <a href="https://www.srcml.org">srcML</a>,
<em>XML</em>, <em>YAML</em>, and <em>Excel</em>.</li>
<li>I thrive on undertaking new challenging projects. I am quite comfortable engaging in and
leading <em>flexible</em> "brain storming" sessions.</li>
<li>I have a long history of providing considerable value added to my employers. Browsing the
links describing the details of my projects will reveal a long history of "home runs". I am
especially proud of my work in fields of <a

the application domains where I normally work.</li>

Automotive Software Updates: CTO Group: (a) I invented a patent-pending algorithm to greatly
reduce RAM consumption during FLASH updates which improves compression efficiency which is the
core KPI of the software update industry; and (b) I greatly improved the CPU efficiency and RAM
consumption of their core product which refactors embedded C source code
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>The company's core product relied upon <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> the automotive client <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">OEM's</a> source code in
order to make it much more efficient to generate software updates. Sometimes their product could
reduce update times 10x compared to the default technique of using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
(i.e. successor to <em>zip</em>) compression.</p></li>
<li><p>I invented an extremely efficient technique to greatly improve the efficiency of their
initial <em>offline</em> refactoring of embedded <em>C</em> software by combining the <a
href="https://www.srcml.org/">srcML</a> compiler <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> output in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> format with the Python <a
href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a> library in order to
generate the refactored source code. I improved their build speed time by 5x (i.e. from 6 hours
to 1 hour) and reduced RAM consumption by 2x (from a 64 GB workstation to 32 GB). Admittedly
their original refactoring engine was a hand coded <em>C</em> to <em>AST</em> compiler which
they implemented in <em>Python</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I invented an algorithm (US patent pending) for embedded systems to greatly reduce RAM
usage when the software generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">FLASH</a>
files by modifying the internals of the ubiquitous <em>C</em> <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memcpy.3.html">memcpy</a> function by
incorporating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">Posix</a>-like buffered I/O when
<em>memcpy</em> is used to sequentially write to <em>FLASH</em>. The RAM savings enables usage
of larger <a href="https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff">bsdiff</a> <em>patch</em> "chunks" that
enables higher compression ratios for legacy system boards with small amounts of RAM, i.e.
64-256 KB. Sometimes compression ratios could be improved by up to 25% - where the critical <a
href="https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/what-is-a-kpi-definition-examples/">KPI</a> in the
software update business is improving compression ratios.</p></li>

Lecturer: Introduction to Cybersecurity
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I had mixed reviews from the students.</p></li>
<li><p>They found I was a superb lecturer because I exhibited mastery of the subject matter and
because I showed them how some of the course materials were regularly used by Cybersecurity
professionals in industry, unlike most of the teaching staff who were full-time
academics.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, they rated me very poorly on my tutorials because I refused to "spoon
feed" them. Admittedly some of the exercises were very difficult, and required substantial
effort to answer them. I argued that it was essential for their understanding of the material
that they solve the exercises themselves. I even stayed after class to help them.</p></li>
<li><p>My takeaway is that if I should teach there again then I will not offer to do
tutorials.</p></li>

Server Cybersecurity: Reverse engineering and refactoring of X64 object code
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I reverse engineered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">X64</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code">object code</a> of the <em>Linux</em> kernel
module <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/libc.7.html">libc</a> in order to modify
the internals of the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html">exec
functions</a>, where these functions are used in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow">stack smashing</a> attacks, <em>but
without changing the addresses of any of the libc exports</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inserting the extra security functionality into these functions necessitated a slight
increase in their sizes, therefore it was quite challenging not to change the addresses of any
of the other <em>libc</em> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>I implemented the project in <em>Python</em> using the <a
href="https://zydis.re">Zydis</a> disassembler <em>Python</em> library.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that every X64 Linux release and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distro</a> will likely have a slightly
different libc object code implementation.</p></li>

Banking Cryptographic Algorithms: Securing C algorithms in a web browser using WASM
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I implemented <em>C</em> cryptography functions in <em>Javascript</em> web assembly (<a
href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>). <em>WASM</em> object code is much faster and much
more difficult to debug than <em>Javascript</em>. Because this project was intended for the
banking industry, in the future we could write a <em>WASM</em> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation">obfuscator</a> that would greatly increase the
difficulty of debugging.</p></li>
<li><p>I implemented the project by using <a

href="https://github.com/thoughtpolice/minibsdiff">mini-bsdiff</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding">delta encoding</a>. Note that <em>delta
encoding</em> enables significantly smaller, e.g. 10x smaller, software updates compared to
<em>zip</em>-like updates when the update contains minor differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>The original <a href="https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff">bsdiff</a> software is not
designed for the size limitations of embedded systems especially for legacy automotive
boards.</li>
<li>In particular the original <em>bsdiff</em> software incorporates the outdated <em>bz</em>
binary compressor that has a 100 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li><em>Mini-bsdiff</em> is not bundled with any binary compressor at all.</li>
<li><em>Mini-bsdiff</em> can be combined with the modern <em>xz</em> binary compressor designed
for embedded systems that only has a 26 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li>It is not computationally feasible to generate an offline <em>mini-bsdiff</em> patch where
at least one of the source files is larger than 8MB, in which case it is preferable to use the
<em>VCDiff/xdiff</em> algorithm which is commonly used on web sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I invented <a
href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/069147491/publication/EP3680773A1?q=20150616.9">EU
Patent EP3680773A1</a>, a <em>mini-bsdiff</em> patch implementation for small <em>FLASH</em>
memory systems where the <em>FLASH</em> is not big enough to temporarily hold both the original
version "A" and new version "B" of the object code. Normally the <em>bsdiff</em> (and
<em>mini-bsdiff</em>) algorithm requires both versions be available when applying the patch. I
had discussions with <em>Colin Percival</em> the original inventor of <em>bsdiff</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with <a
href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/software-updates-courgette/">Google's
Courgette</a> improvement to <em>bsdiff</em>, but it required a relatively large amount of RAM
on the target device in order to support a <em>linker</em>. Such large RAM is not typically
available on legacy boards used in the automotive industry. I invented an algorithm that
dispensed with the need for a linker.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with techniques for using <em>source code</em> patching instead of
<em>bsdiff</em> <em>object code</em> patching. The <em>Elektrobit</em> management refused to
believe that it was commercially feasible to have access to an OEM's source code. I switched
jobs to <a href="#aurora">Aurora Labs</a> above because I believed that <em>Aurora Labs'</em>
source code patching is a better solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I was the company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a>
"enforcer". While I understood the safety rationale and the legal requirements for <em>Misra
C</em>, I found many of their rules to be unnecessarily pedantic. I developed <a
href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a> preprocessing utilities that
worked around these pedantic rules, but that still generated valid <em>Misra C</em>
code.</p></li>

Consultant: SOHO Cybersecurity "Hygiene"
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>The company publicizes and collates social media posts of antisemites, anti-Zionists, and
terrorist "wannabes". Their information was used by the Israeli government immigration
authorities, and by potential employers who often did social media background checks. Because
they were effective at blacklisting (aka "outing") these miscreants, left-wing organizations,
including "progressive" Jewish ones, hated them. They were the subject of intensive hostile
investigations by professional left-wing media organizations including <a
href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/topic/canary-mission/">Times of Israel</a> and <a
href="https://forward.com/tag/canary-mission/">The Forward</a> - who by the way eventually
"outed" them. Therefore the company required cybersecurity "hygiene".</p></li>
<li><p>The vast majority of their employees did journalist-like tasks. They had garden variety
computer skills, and therefore would not be capable of handling sophisticated tasks like using
virtual machine clients (e.g. <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a>) or using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software">PGP</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The following are relatively simple, but effective, cybersecurity defense
recommendations:</p>
<p>a. Use the then most recent Windows 10 Professional O/S on account of its regular security
updates and its support of <a
href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bitlocker-drive-encryption-76b92ac9-1040-48d6-9f5f-d14b3c5fa178">BitLocker</a>
full disk encryption. PCs are lost and stolen.</p>
<p>b. Use a random PC login password from a USB security token such as <a
href="https://www.yubico.com/">Yubico</a>, along with a manual <a
href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/what-is-passphrase/">passphrase</a> suffix. At that
time the basic capability of the token was to store and emit a permanent manufacturer-configured
"random" 16 character password. (More modern keys support additional services such as
<em>TOTP</em> authenticator one-time keys with a timeout). By pressing the button on the token
it would act as a second keyboard in order to allow the password to be emitted into the PC. When
using the emitted password, it is important that the user append it with his own memorized, say
8 character, suffix, otherwise security is compromised if the token is lost or stolen.</p>
<p>c. When the PC is unattended close the cover, and use a screen saver with a relatively short
timeout, e.g. 10 minutes, Configure so that resumption requires a password.</p>
<p>d. Use the <em>Firefox</em> web browser (and especially not <em>Google Chrome</em> !) with
<em>multiple profiles</em> in order to defend against <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">cross-site scripting attacks</a>.
There is no information leakage between profiles. Also still today (2025) Firefox has the best
builtin bookmarking tool. They should at least use the following profiles:</p>
<pre><code> * personal email and banking
 * personal browsing
 * company email and accessing company data
 * work related browsing</code></pre>
<p>e. Use email aliases when required to access potentially hostile social media.</p>
<p>f. Use strong random passwords generated and stored in a <em>local</em> <a
href="https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/">FOSS</a> password database application such as <a
href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePass</a>, and not a commercial password server in the cloud
(which have historically been periodically hacked). And as long as the user used his security
token to protect his password database with his permanent password (appended with his memorized
suffix), then he could safely store the database on a disk-on-key or a cloud file server such as
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a>.</p>
<p>g. Use <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a> for password protection of disk-on-key
storage or file transfers. For file transfers, It has the disadvantage of using shared
passwords, and therefore not nearly as secure as <em>PGP</em>, but definitely far better than
in-the-clear transfers.</p>
<p>h. Make weekly encrypted backups of user data.</p>
<p>i. Assign an employee along with a deputy to be security monitors. They should store backup
security tokens and user PC backups off-site. All employees must pass a quick monthly security
review from the monitor.</p></li>

Internet TV Infrastructure: Cybersecurity obfuscation manager
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I focused on obfuscation, i.e. anti-reverse engineering, of their smartphone (i.e.
Android and iPhone) client player, by selecting a C/C++ obfuscating compiler and by building
home brew utilities. I selected the <em>WhiteCryption</em> compiler originally built by
<em>InterTrust</em> (subsequently acquired by <em>Zimperium</em> in 2021 after I left). When I
first selected <em>WhiteCryption</em>, it was still in the <em>beta</em> stage. I worked very
closely with the <em>WhiteCryption</em> development team - mainly specifying new features and
testing existing ones. Previously I worked on an in-house obfuscation compiler at NDS (called
<em>chameleon</em>), which I considered to be far beyond the manpower resources we had available
at <em>Viaccess-Orca</em>, therefore I decided to use <em>WhiteCryption</em> as our contractor.
After I left <em>Viaccess</em>, they switched to the French <em>Quarkslab</em> obfuscating
compiler partly because <em>Viaccess'</em> HQ is also in France.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my most important utilities I invented was an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format">ELF</a> <a
href="https://www.webopedia.com/definitions/dynamic-shared-object/">Dynamic Share Object
(DSO)</a> (i.e. an <code>so</code> file) which had <em>no export table</em> which ostensibly
eliminates the usefulness of a <em>DSO</em> (thus making the term into an <em>oxymoron</em>). I
designed a low level <em>asynchronous</em> mechanism to load an encrypted export table relying
upon <em>ELF's</em> special <code>init</code> section which executes code in the address space
of the caller when the <em>DSO</em> is first loaded. It is an uncommonly used feature of the
<em>DSO</em>. I designed this mechanism because the export table is one of the major <em>attack
surfaces</em> in a <em>DSO</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with the 3rd party software supplier of the video codec in order to
substantially bolster the security of their product which proved to be a major potential
security hole in our system. The challenge was that most of their customers did not require the
security that we did, and for practical commercial reasons they were not willing to make a
separate build for us. I managed to architect an optional security plugin for them that caused
negligible changes to their system, and caused zero interference to their other customers who
chose not to use a plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially the movie studios insisted that our player client software would not be allowed
to play their content unless the client was <a
href="https://www.androidauthority.com/what-is-rooted-phone-3338226/">rooted</a> because it made
the client considerably more difficult to debug and to prevent piracy. Therefore I developed an
extremely accurate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> algorithm
to detect rootedness with almost no "false positives" (because the out of pocket and negative
publicity costs of falsely accusing a subscriber of having a rooted phone were horrendous). The
problem was that less expensive Android phones from the Far East were flooding the market, were
rooted by default because it saved the manufacturer a few hours of licensing work from Google
who controlled the <a href="https://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project (AOSP)</a>.
Therefore the studios agreed that security had to be moved from the client to the content
servers. For example a subscriber who played 100 hours of content a week was suspect, or a
subscriber who played content simultaneously from different geographic locations was
suspect.</p></li>

PCR MRSA Kit: Inventor of bioinformatic PCR algorithms using AI threshold technique, and more
accurate bioassay normalization and noise reduction</span>
</summary>
<p>The company's product was a novel <em>dry</em> test kit for <a
href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336">MRSA</a>
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> amplification device). <em>MRSA</em> is a
lethal strain of <em>staphylococcus</em> bacteria. It thrives in hospitals where it is the major
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis">iatrogenic</a> killer of immunologically
compromised patients. Therefore it is critically important that hospitals identify carriers
among both patients and hospital staff as soon as they are infected. Most people who are
infected with <em>MRSA</em> carry it in their nasal passages. Most interesting such a person,
even an immunologically compromised one, can still live until 120. However if an immunogically
comprised person touches his nose, and afterwards touches an open wound then he is in danger of
death. Prior to <em>PCR</em> technology, it took a laboratory about 48 hours to identify the
disease by growing a culture in a "gold standard" <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Petri dish</a>, but <em>PCR</em> technology can
make the identification within 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Before joining the company I had zero university background in <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HoVF6iv7OE">biology</a>, microbiology, genetics, or
biochemistry.</strong> When I arrived the company was in imminent danger of closing down their
<em>PCR</em> business unit because their initial <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> trials completely
failed that they had spent about $500K to prepare by collecting 800 patient samples from a few
Israeli hospitals. The owner was "pulling his hair out" because he felt that his science was
100% correct. First he hired <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tzachi-Bar">Tzachi
Bar</a> to consult, the inventor of PCR mathematical algorithms used in all PCR devices at that
time world wide, but <em>Bar</em> could not help him. I happened to be the owner's neighbor. He
knew that I was a computer scientist, so he took his final chance with me. <strong>Within 3
months I made a number of discoveries that validated the owner's science and enabled them to
pass the <em>FDA</em> trials.</strong> In spite of my technical success, for commercial reasons
beyond the scope of my short article, they were forced to close down their <em>PCR</em> business
unit; therefore my <a
href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">threshold algorithm</a> was
never patented.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Initially <em>Bar</em> and the company's chief microbiologist gave me a 2 week crash
course in the fields of microbiology and genetics that they felt I would need for my
work.</p></li>
<li><p>My first task was to generate amplified graphs of all 800 samples, and to study them.
Note that every sample had a <em>PCR</em> result, and an associated "gold standard" <em>Petri
dish</em> result.</p></li>
<li><p>My second task was to carefully read the manual of the <em>PCR</em> device. I noted that
the company's junior microbiologist who was responsible for administering the hospital tests had
used an incorrect protocol for configuring the <em>PCR</em> devices. The 3 control samples that
every batch contains were placed in incorrect test tube slots. Therefore all test results were
nonsensical!</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the samples had been thrown away weeks before I arrived, fortunately they had
saved the raw data from the <em>PCR</em> devices, that allowed me to reconstruct the
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm. The new results were better, but still hardly good enough for
the <em>FDA</em> that required 80% accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>I noted that tests from the pure laboratory colonies of <em>MRSA</em>, with extremely
high concentrations never to be encountered in a patient sample, all failed. This indicated to
me that there was a flaw in the industry standard <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>Secondly I noted that many tests with negative <em>PCR</em> results, in spite of the
positive Petri results, had random graphs instead of the smooth <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay">bioassay</a> sigmoidal shaped curve of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a> that
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> expected. After discussing the matter with <em>Bar</em> and the senior
microbiologist, this indicated that the graphs were statistically noisy due to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a>.
Therefore the company's preliminary chemistry did not yet filter out nasal impurities that
mature chemistry was supposed to do. Maybe we had to "throw in the towel", i.e. to give
up?</p></li>
<li><p>So I put on my "thinking cap", and discovered a completely new algorithm that was much
better than the Bar-Tsichopad algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>I discovered a much more accurate and simple way to normalize the bioassay curve and to
remove systematic noise, by noting that the "systematic" noise and the linear rise in the signal
of the negative control sample precisely matched the patient samples (from the same batch).
Therefore my simple normalization solution was to subtract the negative control sample from the
patient samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <em>Bar</em> and the senior microbiologist agreed with me that inhibition never
increases the <em>PCR</em> signal. Therefore I used an alternative <a
href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">AI threshold test</a>,
instead of the <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> test that was based upon advanced mathematical functional
analysis to calculate the <a
href="https://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center/real-time-pcr-basics/real-time-pcr-understanding-ct.html">Ct</a>
of the assay.</p></li>
<li><p>I split the patient samples in half. For the control half, I used the single maximum
signal from each sample. I recorded minimum PCR signal that indicated a positive Petri result.
And similarly I recorded the maximum PCR signal indicated a negative Petri result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I used the other half of the patient samples to test my new threshold algorithm.
My predictions were 95% accurate in spite of the high degree of inhibition found in the
preliminary chemistry!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The explanation for the minor inaccuracy was some results were in the "gray" region where
there was an overlap between the minimum PCR signal to indicate a positive result, and the
maximum PCR signal to indicate a negative result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>My threshold algorithm won a MRSA "shoot out" at the world famous UK <a
href="https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/">St Georges medical school hospital</a> against competing
PCR kits from the huge international pharmaceutical companies!</strong></p></li>

Internet TV Infrastructure: Cybersecurity researcher
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>Most of my work at NDS was doing software security research including occasional code
security audits.</p></li>
<li><p>I was one of the first security researchers in the world to prove that the ubiquitous
virtual machine packages, e.g. <em>VMWare</em> and <em>VirtualBox</em>, could break simple
<em>DRM</em> protection schemes like date restrictions or replay count.</p></li>
<li><p>I showed how <em>X64</em> virtualization hardware could be used together with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU">QEMU</a> to break the software random number generator
(RNG). This was a very critical attack because the fundamental security assumption was that each
client PC had a worldwide unique cryptographic "nonce". But if confederate clients could share
their nonces on their own trivial web server then a single license could be shared by all
members of the confederacy. At that time, c. 2007, the cycle counter instruction
<code>RDTSC</code> was easily subverted by the virtualization technology. After I left the
company, since 2012 the CPU has a hardware RNG instruction <code>RDRAND</code> which is a much
safer instruction from the perspective of security.</p></li>
<li><p>I invited outside security researchers to give lectures and seminars to in-house
developers on state-of-the-art security techniques. Based upon these lectures I developed an
obfuscated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>-like
compiler that was extremely difficult to reverse engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2007 NDS was invited by the Chinese government CCTV system to protect the 2008 Beijing
Olympics TV feed. I "almost" won the contract. The Chinese government did not want Microsoft to
be involved in the bidding because nearly 100% of servers and client PCs had stolen operating
system licenses which could easily be revealed when Microsoft installed the protection software.
At time the Olympic TV feed was owned by a Microsoft company MSNBC. Eventually Microsoft agreed
not to sue China for the stolen operating system licenses, and they offered the protection
package for free so they won the contract.</p></li>
<li><p>The Israeli satellite TV operators had their feed stolen by Israeli expats in the US, and
more massively in the Palestinian areas. I showed how to it was possible to easily technically
stop these thefts. For reasons that are still not clear to me, the operators showed no interest
in stopping these thefts.</p></li>
<li><p>My first job at NDS was as a quality assurance (<em>QA</em>) contractor. I built a tester
and simulator for the NDS satellite software. I designed a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a>
in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> to do this task. After my analysis of
their software, I concluded that there were critical flaws in its design. I was quite
knowledgeable in VAX/VMS O/S internals. The junior VP in charge of the project refused to
believe that a "mere QA guy" could have such knowledge, so I built a graduated test program that
blew his (virtual) satellite out of the sky. Afterwards my software was installed on every
developer's desktop. Before checking in software into their version control system, it became
standard operating procedure to run a 10 minute test prior to check-in.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with NDS' <em>QA</em> department to analyze their bug reports, and concluded
that nearly 50% of their software effort was bug fixes. And they had more than 1000 software
developers! I worked with the QA department in order to implement a program to greatly reduce
bugs. I recall that their biggest problem was lazy software builds that often contained tens of
thousands of warnings. My most important improvement was insisting on zero warnings, or adding
explicit compiler approval of any warning to be explicitly allowed.</p></li>

<li><p>By selecting 24-port programmable layer-2 switches for each of the PC's 4x100 MB Ethernet
ports, each PC was able to control 96 cable modems during low speed ping tests, whereas
previously each PC could only control 4 modems (i.e. one per Ethernet port), which resulted in
massive (24x) cost savings through the reduction of PCs and their associated electrical

<li><p>For high speed testing at 8 MB per modem, each PC's Ethernet port could only support 12

<li><p>I Implemented automated control of the lab in <a

<li><p>Instead of implementing speed tests with Cisco's network utilities which relied upon a

Blind Accessibility Device: VP R&amp;D: Inventor of product that allowed the blind to
see/understand images in a PC/smartphone web browser ideally combined with a consumer grade
graphics tablet
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I invented a software system that allowed the blind to "see" and to understand computer
images, especially maps and mathematical functions, using a</p>
<p>a. standard PC or smartphone web browser</p>
<p>b. the device's builtin speaker</p>
<p>c. ideally a consumer grade graphics tablet and stylus (e.g. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Graphic-Drawing-Tablet-Beginners/dp/B07S1RR3FR">Wacom
Bamboo</a> ~$50)</p>
<p>d. and optionally, but less preferably, with the device's builtin mouse</p></li>
<li><p>The software heavily relied upon the builtin <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">standard vector graphics (SVG)</a> capability of all
modern web browsers (since 1999).</p>
<p>a. <em>SVG</em> is an <em>XML</em> variant.</p>
<p>b. <em>SVG</em> returns the position and color at the cursor.</p>
<p>c. Unlike <em>JPG</em> or <em>PNG</em> pixelated images, <em>SVG</em> has the ability to
smoothly zoom in or zoom out of vector images.</p></li>
<li><p>The basic concept can be understood by using an example image of a circle.</p>
<p>a. Let the display be black, except for the perimeter of the circle which is a few pixels
wide and which is colored white.</p>
<p>b. In the simple case where the user's stylus hovers over a white pixel, a sound is played,
but hovering over a black pixel yields no sound.</p>
<p>c. Blind users prefer a graphics tablet to a mouse because blind users still have hand-eye
(or actually mind-eye) coordination, so they can easy navigate around the tablet. Mice have the
problem that the cursor gets stuck at the edge of the display when you scroll beyond the edge.
It is possible to provide sonic cues to ameliorate this problem, but using a tablet and stylus
is much easier.</p>
<p>d. Divide the screen into a grid of 96x96 rectangles, or equivalently 8x8 12-tone chromatic
octaves. Let the horizontal (x) axis be represented by a piano, and the vertical (y) axis be
represented by a flute. Instead of playing the same sound for all white pixel positions, play
the xy note combination in the grid position where the cursor is located.</p>
<p>e. If we would use two intersecting circles, say one white and blue, we could use different
instrument combinations to represent the colors, and/or we could use the keyboard or click on
the stylus to query which circle we are touching, where the application will provide a
text-to-speech response.</p></li>
<li><p>Images need to be prepared offline. But in the case of maps, most of which are already
designed using <em>XML</em> variants, it is possible to programmatically automate their
preparation.</p></li>

<li><p>Elop was a primary subcontractor for the <em>BlackHawk</em> helicopter missile fire
control system for the US company <em>LORAL</em> who was the main contractor for the helicopter
(which was acquired by <em>Lockheed Martin</em>). They had an acceptance testing manual that
specified over 1000 tests that the fire control system must pass. There were about 10

Fabless DSP CPU Design Center: Inventor and S/W architect of a DSL to implement the software
tool chain for the PINE CPU
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p><em>DSPG</em> designed CPU micro-controllers that supported DSP functionality. When I
joined them they were working on their original <em>PINE</em> chip. They were a VLSI "fabless"
design center. After finishing their designs, they had them manufactured by a real physical
"fab". At that time it could take up to 6 months for the fab to manufacture the physical chip.
Design flaws would be horrendously expensive. And <em>DSPG</em> designed the application
software that ran on their chips. At that time they designed the hardware and software internals
for consumer telephone answering machines.</p></li>
<li><p>VLSI software simulations ran extremely slowly because they simulated the low level
transistor details of their circuitry.</p></li>
<li><p>My job was (1) to design a clock accurate simulator that would run about 100x faster than
the VLSI simulator, and (2) to supply an assembler and <em>C</em> compiler that could be used to
test software applications months before the fab manufactured the physical chip.</p></li>
<li><p>At that time the first release of <em>QEMU</em> would be about 15 years away, and the GCC
tool chain was not yet mature, i.e. pre 2.95, so I had to design my own assembler, simulator,
linker, compiler, and debugger, for an early version of Microsoft Windows.</p></li>
<li><p>The key to the success of this project was my design of a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a>
to formally describe each one of the CPU's opcodes, and most important to recognize when an
instruction sequence would cause the pipeline to "stall". We built the <em>DSL</em> using
<em>lex</em> and <em>yacc</em>. At that time it was not yet common industry practice that CPU
designers could automatically dynamically insert delays into the instruction pipeline. It was
the job of the application programmer (or the compiler) to automatically insert these delays. My
<em>DSL</em> included an easy to specify language that detected stall conditions. Without this
stall detection feature it was impossible for us to develop the assembler in a timely fashion,
because in the early stages of the design, the VLSI architects made major changes to the stall
conditions almost daily. Therefore our manually coded stall condition analyzer had to constantly
be rewritten. But once we implemented this feature, we could generate an updated assembler
almost immediately, i.e. within a hour or two.</p></li>
<li><p>Another very important feature was that when debugging an application we could
programmatically simulate access to the <em>I/O</em> ports. Still more than 15 years after the
first release of <em>QEMU</em>, i.e. 2025, this is not yet a builtin feature of state-of-the art
<em>QEMU</em> simulators.</p></li>
<li><p>The system worked as planned. Especially important is that application developers were
able to supply working debugged applications months before the physical chip became
available.</p></li>

Metal Blade Production Factory: Co-inventor and S/W architect of a DSL to implement a shop floor
production control system that orchestrated a completely automated factory
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>Iscar's <em>Matkash</em> plant in <em>Tefen</em> in northern Israel was an uber hi-tech
factory that manufactured hundreds of different small cutting blades according to different
chemical compositions and sizes via a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering">sintering</a> process. Typically the blades were
bonded to steel materials, e.g. a circular saw.</p></li>
<li><p>The plant was totally automated. Human intervention was required in the event of
maintenance or an accident.</p></li>
<li><p>The plant included:</p>
<ul>
<li>various types of workstations that had multiple stands where parts and raw materials were
placed, and the end product was removed</li>
<li>robotic arms automatically inserted parts and raw materials into the station, and removed
the end product</li>
<li>robotic automatically guided vehicles delivered and removed pallets from the workstations to
the correct stand, and moved them to the conveyor system or to the storage area</li>
<li>some pallets were transported by conveyor</li>
<li>some pallets were placed on stacks</li>
<li>pallets were temporarily stored in a storage area made up of hundreds of stands</li>
<li>work-in-progress parts that were stored for too long had to oiled in order to prevent
rust</li>
<li>tools that required maintenance, e.g. cutting tools, recorded their consumption before being
sent for repair (e.g. sharpening)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>My job and that of my partner was to automatically orchestrate the plant via S/W. We had
a powerful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVMS">VAX/VMS</a> computer at our disposal
with a relational database. Our liaison from <em>DEC</em> insisted that the main programming
language be <em>Pascal</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>We came to the project with no knowledge of factory automation. So we started with month
long mentoring from an industrial engineer who did.</p></li>
<li><p>Our solution was to design a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a>
that described every single object (i.e. a few hundred 100) in the factory's "object kingdom",
and how they interacted with one another. The <em>DSL</em> had to configurable by the factory
engineer who was not a software engineer, while the clerical staff required a <em>GUI</em>
window into the <em>DSL</em> for making on-the-fly configurations and viewing the status of the
factory.</p></li>
<li><p>It became immediately obvious that the S/W required <em>object oriented</em> techniques
to implement. At that time <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object oriented programming
(OOP)</a> was just being developed in research/university settings. The first version of
<em>C++</em> was just released, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL">SNOBOL</a>
was an <em>OOP</em> research prototype. There was no Internet yet at that time, but literature
was available in the Hebrew Univ computer science library. Recall that we had a hard requirement
to use the procedural <em>Pascal</em> language,</p></li>
<li><p><em>VAX/VMS</em> had a command line utility for designing command "ensembles" which could
be executed via callbacks to a compilable language, e.g. <em>Pascal</em>. We used these
ensembles to define every type of object, along with their attributes, supported by the our
<em>DSL</em>. Today (2025), 30 years later, I would use XML instead (which had not yet been
invented).</p></li>
<li><p>There were tens of thousands object instances stored in a database on disk - including
their configuration and current status. The database regularly stored status updates. The
database was constantly scanned in order to implement the next task that our scheduler required.
In the event that the main computer shut down, either expectedly or unexpectedly, the database
allowed for a smooth restart/recovery.</p></li>
<li><p>After about a year, we implemented a working factory!</p></li>

High Speed Sewing Robot For Leather Goods: S/W architect of a DSL used to control the robot

must be followed in real-time.</p></li>
<li><p>Since leather is a natural fabric, no pieces are identical with respect to size,
thickness, and color. An expert human sewing machine operator will take these differences into
account. Therefore the robot required a live video feed which had to be analyzed in real
time.</p></li>
<li><p>A high speed sewing robot can execute a few thousand stitches per minute. On account of
torque, it takes a few seconds to change speed. Making mistakes may cause the machine to make
hundreds of unnecessary stitches which could seriously damage the expensive fabric.</p></li>
<li><p>Among other things, the "road" signs specify minimum and maximum speeds, the sizes of the
minimum and maximum overlapping regions, the pattern matching algorithm to be used depending

Public Utility Commission: Public interest intervenor-economist at the ECAP77 hearings on
marginal cost pricing for electricity
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I was the first public interest <a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intervenor">intervenor</a> in the history of
the <em>OEB</em> to be awarded costs - at the suggestion of the <em>OEB</em>!</p></li>
<li><p>In a nutshell <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost">marginal cost
pricing</a> is also referred to as "congestion pricing". The majority of consumers understand
that the price for road tolls or parking lots or tourism facilities, etc., should be much higher
during peak usage periods. The same principle holds true for electric power generation.
Therefore it was always recommended to activate electric water boilers in the middle of the
night (and similarly today when charging electric vehicles), but the flat rate system provided
no price incentive to do so. Generation "base" stations that run 24x7, e.g. nuclear, produce
less expensive electricity than "intermediate" coal station designed to run 8 hours a day, and
there are huge differences in the price of electricity from gas turbines designed to run during
peak loads that occur a few hundred hours per year (e.g. during extreme weather conditions). But
for the previous 50 years consumers were used to flat rates.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to intense political pressure from the mineral smelting industry, who relied upon
subsidized electricity prices and who directly employed tens of thousands of people and who
threatened to leave the province if the subsidies were removed, the Ontario government caved in
to the pressure, and forced the public electric utility, then called <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hydro">Ontario Hydro</a>, to withdraw their case
after the hearings had already begun. I became the primary intervenor at the hearings to present
the case for <a href="https://www.britannica.com/money/marginal-cost-pricing">marginal cost
pricing</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I published a full page op-ed about the hearings in Canada's then newspaper of record <a
href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a>. In that article I proposed to
immediately economically rationalize electricity prices, while simultaneously granting the
smelting industry with gradually decreasing annual subsidies to help them make the transition to
the new pricing scheme. My proposal was a political "non-starter" because the politicians could
never sell to the general public granting explicit subsidies to some of the wealthiest
corporations in the province, even though it was clear that subsidized electric prices fostered
general growth of electric power consumption with the concomitant outrageous financial
consequences associated with expanding generation capacity (i.e. at the time building new
nuclear power stations). Instead the politicians preferred to treat the general public as fools
by arguing that maintaining the <em>status quo</em> of flat pricing (and even worse by granting
discounts to industrial consumers) did not constitute a subsidy.</p></li>
<li><p>I initially learned about the hearings from a course in my MBA program (1976) when I
complained to the Ontario Hydro economic team (beside the Univ campus) about the mediocre
<em>B</em> grade my professor gave me on my term paper. At the same time I had my discussions
with the economic team, the government ordered them to withdraw their proposal. They suggested
to me that I join the hearings as a public interest intervenor to advocate <em>marginal cost
pricing</em> in their stead, and that they would give me behind the scenes technical support. I
agreed to their proposal. I would have the exact same legal standing as the smelting industry
because I paid a shared electric bill of about $25 a month!</p></li>
<li><p>This job was a formative learning experience for me that subsequently effected my whole
life because I learned that a single individual can effectively stand up to the corruption of
large business and government. With perfect hindsight, it was clearly a case of Divine
intervention (Hebrew: <em>Hashgacha Pratit</em>). Years later in my life in Israel, I became
involved in a number of community service projects where I showed that a single individual can
make a difference and successfully push back against government corruption. (See <em>future</em>
articles in my web site on my community service).</p></li>

<p>Unlike CRC-32, the major flaw with Adler-32 is its lack of "spread" in the domain of
<code>sum</code>. Clearly short messages will have too small a spread, which results in many
collisions. However it is very easy to correct this problem by using a constant multiplier
<code>k</code> which is a function of <code>n</code>. We still retain the speed and simplicity
of the original algorithm. This algorithm is quite useful as an extremely fast

<p>This algorithm wraps a 32-bit number with a 64-bit key and a pseudo-random 32-bit number; and
where the ALU can process 128-bit numbers then we can wrap a 64-bit number with a 128-bit key
and a pseudo-random 64-bit number. The random number can be generated on-the-fly in a local
random number generator. The algorithm is extremely fast. It is implemented in a few assembly
instructions. It can be executed <code>inline</code>. Therefore it is quite useful for

<h3 id="inner-cross-hamming-weight">3. Crypto: <em>Invertible</em> "Cross Hamming Weight"
Transformation</h3>
<p>Rotating a number by its Hamming weight is a cryptographically weak transformation because
(1) the transformation does not change the original Hamming weight, and (2) Hamming weights have
a binomial distribution where the weight has an extremely high probability of being in the
center of the distribution.</p>
<p>This invention improves these flaws. The transformation flattens the distribution by (1)
making the upper and lower half of the number into 2 adjacent <code>N/2</code>-bit binomial
distributions, and (2) 75% of the time it changes the original Hamming weight. And it is
possible to apply the transformation twice, where the result is 4 adjacent <code>N/4</code>-bit
binomial distributions.</p>
<details>
<p>The algorithm is implemented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The original number is split in half into its lower bits and upper bits. Both Hamming
weights are calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-complement-operator-tilde/">bit-wise
complemented</a> when the Hamming weight of the upper bits is <em>even</em> , while the upper
bits will be complemented when the Hamming weight of the lower bits is <em>odd</em>. Note that
the complement operation is invertible because it does not change parity.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be rotated by the original Hamming weight of the upper bits, and
<em>vice versa</em>. Similarly the rotation operation is invertible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern CPUs have a Hamming weight (aka <code>popcount</code>) instruction, therefore the
run-time overhead of using this transformation is negligible.</p>
<p>The transformation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">invertible</a>. After applying it to a
trivial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">LCG PRNG</a> which
is cryptographically very weak, the industry standard <a
href="https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/how-to-test-with-practrand.html">PractRand</a> analysis
shows the result to be as good as the highest quality PRNGs commonly used today. This
transformation is much stronger than the <a

Hamming Weight</h3>
<p>This algorithm calculates a value in the same range as classic Hamming weights, but the
distribution is "nearly" uniformly distributed except for minor perturbations. For example a
32-bit number returns a weight in the range [0,32]. The algorithm is highly non-linear, i.e.
cryptographically "bent".</p>
<details>
<ol>
<li><code>WIDTH</code> is the bit width of the domain of <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We successively squeeze <code>x</code> by dividing it into 2-bit width groups, 4-bit width
groups, 8-bit width groups, etc., where the maximum width is <code>WIDTH/4</code>.</li>
<li>We calculate the classical Hamming weight of each squeezed <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We use their weighted sums, where the weight is the width, modulo <code>WIDTH+1</code> to
calculate the FFT Hamming weight.</li>

<h3 id="inner-binary-hash-table">5. Container: Binary Expandable Hash Table</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Typically the maximum number of entries in a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> is a <em>prime number</em>, while
my algorithm uses <code>2**N</code> entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically when expanding the size of a hash table, all entries must be rehashed, while my
algorithm does not require any rehashing.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically hash tables are "sparse", i.e. they contain many empty entries, because the
same data structure is used to store both the data associated with the keys, and to
search/update keys. My algorithm uses two separate data structures which greatly minimizes
sparseness. One structure defines the maximum number of keys, while the second structure defines
the maximum number of data entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the operating system supports the <em>Linux</em> <code>vmalloc</code> or the
<em>Win32</em> <code>VirtualAlloc</code> allocators, then it is possible to allocate large
memory regions with virtually linear address spaces but are composed of physically
non-contiguous pages. My algorithm can take advantage of these allocators to further reduce
sparseness, and not to move the data associated with existing keys when the table is
expanded.</p></li>

<h3 id="inner-dynamic-flash-config-file">6. Embedded Systems: Dynamically Loadable FLASH
Configuration Files Larger Than RAM</h3>
<p>On embedded systems with limited RAM, it is <em>not</em> possible to load large configuration
files into RAM, and it is normally a security risk to parse the configuration file when
dynamically loading it regardless of its size. My invention allows the use of an off-line
<em>pre-parsed</em> configuration file into object data format <em>without any executable
code</em>. It can be dynamically loaded into <em>FLASH</em> memory at an address defined at load
time where (1) the system architect must have mapped the <em>FLASH</em> memory accordingly, (2)
the <em>C</em> structure of object file must be recognized by the control program, and (3) it is
extremely difficult (although not impossible) to modify the configuration for the duration of
the load.</p>
<p>The format can be designed to support variable sized memory regions in a way that can be
legally supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a> mandated
rules for safe programming design in industries such as automotive, aircraft, and medical
equipment, etc. Normally <em>Misra C</em> forbids the use of variable sized data structures. For
example, <em>Misra C</em> rules normally force developers to allocate space for sparse arrays,
so that an array of file names would require enough space in each array element to support the
longest possible file name. However my invention enables the array elements to be stored in a
packed heap in <em>FLASH</em>, so that each array element is a pointer into the heap.</p>
<p>I show how the off-line pre-parser can be implemented without any executable <em>C</em> code
by taking advantage of the GCC's <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html">designated initializer</a>
feature along with <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a>

<h3 id="inner-dyslexic-font">8. Accessibility: Generic Dyslexic Font</h3>
<p>I invented a scheme to modify existing fonts so that a dyslexic can easily read them by
mimicking the concept how computer vision programs can decipher <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> regardless of how they are rotated.
You should note that in QR codes there are 3 solid black squares in the top-left, top-right, and
bottom-left corners, but not in the bottom-right corner. My invention pads the left and right
margins of each character in the font, allowing space for two vertical strips in each margin.
Each character will have the same size padding. In the middle of the inner left strip, I add a
diacritical dot. Now the dyslexic reader needs to follow a single rule, namely to note that a
validly oriented character has a dot in its inner left margin. The margins have to be wide
enough, so that the reader can recognize the spacing between a sequence of characters.</p>

<li><strong>Born:</strong> 1957 Canada.</li>
<li><strong>Aliyah (English: immigration to Israel)</strong>: 1983.
<ul>
<li>My triple great grandfather, Rav Aharon Visanska 1809-1893, was born in a rural region of
Augustow Poland. He was a disciple of the Vilna Gaon (Hebrew: <em>Gra</em>). As a young adult he
resided in Jerusalem. He emigrated to Michigan where he raised his family and became a community
rabbi. He returned to Jerusalem where he died and was buried on the Mount of Olives (Hebrew:
<em>Har HaZeitim</em>). His granddaughter Rachel 1874-1919, my great grandmother, was born in
Michigan. She married a Canadian immigrant from Poland, Yechiel Michael 1872-1926, my great
grandfather, who was born in the same Polish community as Rav Aharon's. Their eldest son Hershel
Tzvi 1896-1977, my grandfather, was born in Ontario. He fought in <em>WW I</em> in the
<em>Jewish Legion</em> in Turkey and later in Palestine under <em>General Allenby</em>. Hershel
Tzvi returned to Ontario where I was eventually born.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Married:</strong> I have 2 boys and 2 girls, all married with many grandchildren,
all of whom live in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (English: the Land of Israel).
<ul>
<li>Since the Hamas <em>Simchat Torah</em> (2023-10-07) massacre, both of my sons spent about 6
months in the IDF, and as of this writing (2025-03-10) they both were recently called up for 2
months of reserve duty (Hebrew: <em>Miluim</em>).</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Religious Beliefs:</strong> I am a God-fearing observant Jew and Zionist.</li>
<li><strong>IDF Reserves 1988-2001:</strong> I was a combat infantry sergeant, where I served in
the Central Command (Hebrew: <em>Pikud HaMerkaz</em>) in the Jordan Valley.
<ul>
<li>Exceptionally I often acted in the role of deputy company commander (Hebrew: <em>Samap</em>)
even though I was a <em>Shlav Betnik</em> (English: those first drafted over age 26) with only 4
months of basic training. Considering that the IDF intended to send me to a combat infantry unit
for the whole period of my 13 years of reserve duty, about 2/3 of my basic training was a
complete waste of time, e.g. kitchen duty, gardening duty, and guard duty, instead of primarily
focusing on combat skills.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Sport:</strong> I still engage in regular vigorous exercise at a gym for 90 min. 3x
per week - cardio and heavy weights. When I was younger I engaged in Judo, freestyle wrestling,
and Tai Chi.</li>
<li><strong>Meditation:</strong> I developed my own meditation technique based upon the
principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_resonance">sympathetic
harmonics</a>. Within minutes I can lower my pulse to under 55 bpm. I can quickly teach this
technique to others with just a clock that has a sweep second hand, and ideally by using a high
speed metronome app that supports 300 beats per min., i.e. 5 Hz the brain's <a
href="https://www.healthline.com/health/theta-waves">theta wave</a> frequency.</li>
<li><strong>Hobbies:</strong> I play classical guitar (currently rusty). I teach the use of
music composition software to my musically inclined children (one of whom is a concert cellist)
and grandchildren.</li>
<li><strong>Android Phone &amp; PC Windows and Linux Repairs:</strong> For family and close
friends.</li>

<p>I designed this novel document format in (<em>FOSS</em>) <em>pandoc</em> <em>markdown</em>
under <em>Ubuntu</em>. I used (<em>FOSS</em>) <em>Pyexpander</em> for macro preprocessing. The
following two formats were automatically generated from the same <em>markdown</em> source file:
(1) HTML, and (2) PDF (using the <em>wkhtmltopdf</em> plugin). As is standard in the hi-tech
industry, the mandatory PDF format incorporates a single line for the employer name, and a short
headline about the details of the task. Superficially the HTML version mimics the same format.
The PDF headline links to the HTML version, where the HTML version uses the HTML
<code>&lt;details&gt;</code> tag to optionally allow viewing the full description of the task.
This design is similar to a web news site with a listing of headlines that enables clicking to
access details. The advantage of this scheme is that most <em>HR</em> departments forbid their
readers from contacting a candidate for more details without first conducting an official
interview which is a major formal process. My scheme short circuits this dilemna to the
advantage of both the reader and the candidate. See my source code at: <a

<li id="fn1"><p><strong>Secure Photo:</strong> This secure photo was built using <a
href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> blurring filters (e.g. Gaussian, clothify, and oilify)
along with a prominent distorted visible email address watermark. This digital "camouflage" will
defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson
has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1)
Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be digitally
compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication
(2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying
my photo while attempting to associate it with any other person besides me. Similarly if a site
were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association with
them then it would be trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to challenge the
site by asking me for a verification email. And it would be interesting to consider adding an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation">Eurion</a> currency watermark that
would fool Photoshop software along with high quality printers and scanners into believing that
the watermarked photo is a banknote in order to prevent it from being manipulated or printed.
The general field of obscuring personal information is referred to as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification">de-identification</a>. There was an
Israeli company, <em>D-ID</em> now defunct, that specialized in obscurring high quality images
without using any blurring filters which could not be used in automated password verification
scanners!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p><strong>Autodidact Polymath:</strong> There is a common misconception that only
geniuses like <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> deserve the appellation autodidact polymath, and
therefore by referring to myself as one then I am making the bombastic claim to be a genius in
the same category as Leonardo. There is an outstanding <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGF3kjgCaMQ">TED talk</a> showing how children from Indian
slums with the appropriate mentoring can become <em>autodidact polymaths</em>. And there was a
similarly successful project done with children from <a
href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/free-thinkers/">Mexican slums</a>. Many very intelligent
people, especially as they get older, don’t like moving outside of their intellectual comfort
zone, whereas I revel in taking on intellectual challenges in new fields outside of my comfort
zone. Note my "grand slams" in a wide range of application domains, where the only way to
quickly achieve expertise was self-learning admittedly with the help of highly qualified
mentors. I feel that I still maintain a high degree of child-like <a
href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/neuroplasticity">mental plasticity</a>. Part of
this skill I retain by regular interaction with my own young grandchildren, where my play with
them is much more analytical than I used to exhibit with my own children.<a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3"><p><strong>York Univ:</strong> Exceptionally I passed my comprehensive examinations
before I took any of the required economics courses! Therefore the school allowed me to take any
accredited courses from any Canadian university. I had initially wanted to take a graduate
degree in engineering from the Univ of Toronto but they refused to accept me as a
<em>regular</em> student, but they allowed me to enroll as a <em>special</em> student. In fact
most of my courses for the York degree were from the Univ of Toronto graduate school of
engineering.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
