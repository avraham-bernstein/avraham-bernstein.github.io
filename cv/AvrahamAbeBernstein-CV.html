<h2>Introduction</h2>
<ol>
<li>I have more than 40 years experience in state-of-the-art software development especially
inventing new algorithms.</li>
<li>I have many inventions and some <strong>recent patents</strong> in a wide variety of
application domains, e.g.:
<ul>
<li>digital automotive industry</li>
<li>Internet TV</li>
<li>cybersecurity and anti-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse
engineering</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a></li>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>factory automation</li>
<li>VLSI chip design</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In order to jump start my learning process I prefer to find a domain expert to mentor me,
and I am also a good mentor myself.</li>
<li>I am an <a href="https://simplicable.com/new/expert-generalist">expert generalist</a> and an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism">autodidact</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath">polymath</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. I easily learn and become an expert in new
fields.</li>
<li>I am a "hands-on" master software engineer. I enjoy programming. I design prototypes and
minimum viable products for <em>CTO</em> groups.</li>
<li>I know many computer languages which I am able to learn easily due to my <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a> background; and my compiler
background allows me to design <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages
(DSL)</a> and to engage in automated <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">code refactoring</a>.</li>
<li>I don't market myself as a programmer any more, but my "go to" <em>programming</em>
languages in which I am quite proficient are the following:
<ul>
<li><em>C</em></li>
<li><em>Python</em> and <em>BeautifulSoup</em></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine)">Jinaj2</a>, the "gold
standard" macro and template preprocessor</li>
<li><a href="https://pyexpander.sourceforge.io/">Pyexpander</a>, which is simpler than
<em>Jinja2</em> and just as useful except where inheritance is needed, <em>but</em>
unfortunately it is <em>polluted</em> by a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPLv3 license</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a>, including <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_POSIX_commands">Posix CLI commands</a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>My "go to" <em>data</em> languages are <em>HTML</em>, <em>Markdown</em>, <a
href="https://www.pandoc.org">pandoc</a>, <a href="https://www.srcml.org">srcML</a>,
<em>XML</em>, <em>YAML</em>, and <em>Excel</em>.</li>
<li>I thrive on undertaking new challenging projects. I am quite comfortable engaging in and
leading <em>flexible</em> "brain storming" sessions.</li>
<li>I provide considerable value added to my clients.</li>

Automotive Software Updates: researcher in CTO office
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>The company's core product relied upon <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a> the automotive client <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer">OEM's</a> source code in
order to make it much more efficient to generate software updates. Sometimes their product could
reduce update times by a factor of 10 compared to the default technique of using <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm">LZMA</a>
(i.e. successor to <em>zip</em>) compression.</p></li>
<li><p>I invented an extremely efficient technique to greatly improve the efficiency of their
initial refactoring software by combining the <a href="https://www.srcml.org/">SRCML</a>
compiler <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">AST</a> output in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> format with the Python <a
href="https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Beautiful Soup</a> library in order to
generate the refactored source code.</p></li>
<li><p>And I invented a technique (US patent pending) to greatly reduce RAM usage when the
embedded software generates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_memory">FLASH</a> files
by modifying the internals of the ubiquitous <em>C</em> <a
href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/memcpy.3.html">memcpy</a> function by
incorporating <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">Posix</a>-like buffered I/O when
memcpy is used to sequentially write to FLASH. The RAM savings enables usage of larger "chunks"
that enables higher compression ratios for legacy system boards with small amounts of RAM, e.g.
less than 256 KB. Sometimes compression ratios could be improved by 25%.</p></li>

Server Cybersecurity: reverse engineering object code
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I reverse engineered the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64">X64</a> <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_code">object code</a> of the <em>Linux</em> kernel
module <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/libc.7.html">libc</a> in order to modify
the internals of the <a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html">exec
functions</a>, where these functions are used in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_buffer_overflow">stack smashing</a> attacks, <em>but
without changing the addresses of any of the libc exports</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Inserting the extra security functionality into these functions necessitated a slight
increase in their sizes, therefore it was quite challenging not to change the addresses of any
of the other <em>libc</em> functions.</p></li>
<li><p>I implemented the project in <em>Python</em> using the <a
href="https://zydis.re">Zydis</a> disassembler <em>Python</em> library.</p></li>
<li><p>Note that every X64 Linux release and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_distribution">distro</a> will likely have a slightly
different libc object code implementation.</p></li>

Banking Cybersecurity Using WASM: software consultant
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I implemented <em>C</em> cryptography functions in <em>Javascript</em> web assembly (<a
href="https://webassembly.org/">WASM</a>). _WASM_object code is much faster and much more
difficult to debug than <em>Javascript</em>. Because this project was intended for the banking
industry, in the future we could write a <em>WASM</em> <a

difficulty of debugging.</p></li>

Automotive Software Updates: software research
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I architected and implemented a software design for efficient software updates of
embedded systems using mini-bsdiff delta encoding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note that the original bsdiff software is not designed for the size limitations of embedded
systems especially for legacy automotive boards.</li>
<li>In particular the original bsdiff software incorporates the outdated bz binary compressor
that has a 100 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li>Mini-bsdiff is not bundled with any binary compressor at all.</li>
<li>Mini-bsdiff can be combined with the modern xz binary compressor designed for embedded
systems that only has a 26 KB RAM footprint.</li>
<li>It is not computationally feasible to generate an offline mini-bsdiff patch where at least
one of the source files is larger than 8MB, in which case it is preferable to use the
VCDiff/xdiff algorithm which is commonly used on web sites.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I invented <a
href="https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/069147491/publication/EP3680773A1?q=20150616.9">EU
Patent EP3680773A1</a>, a mini-bsdiff patch implementation for small FLASH memory systems where
the FLASH is not big enough to temporarily hold both the original version "A" and new version
"B" of the object code. Normally bsdiff requires both versions be available when applying the
patch.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with Google's Courgette improvement to bsdiff, but it required a
relatively large amount of RAM on the target device to support a linker. The large RAM is not
typically available on legacy boards used in the automotive industry. I developed an algorithm
that dispensed with the need for a linker.</p></li>
<li><p>I experimented with techniques for using source code patching instead of bsdiff object
patching. The Elektrobit management refused to believe that it was commercially feasible to have
access to an OEM's source code. I switched jobs to <a href="#aurora">Aurora Labs</a> above
because I believed that source code patching is a better solution.</p></li>
<li><p>I was the company's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a>
"enforcer". While I understood the safety rationale and the legal requirements for <em>Misra
C</em>, I found many of their rules to be unnecessarily pedantic. I developed <a
href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a> preprocessing utilities that
worked around these pedantic rules, but that still generated valid <em>Misra C</em>
code.</p></li>

Internet TV Cybersecurity: S/W security manager
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I focused on obfuscation, i.e. anti-reverse engineering, of their smartphone (i.e.
Android and iPhone) client player, by selecting a C/C++ obfuscating compiler and by building
home brew utilities. I selected the WhiteCryption compiler originally built by InterTrust and
acquired by Zimperium in 2021 after I left. When I first selected the product WhiteCryption was
still in the beta stage. I worked very closely with the WhiteCryption development team - mainly
specifying new features and testing existing ones. Previously I worked on an in-house
obfuscation compiler at NDS, which I considered far beyond the manpower resources we had at
Viaccess-Orca. After I left Viaccess, they switched to the French Quarkslab compiler partially
because Viaccess HQ is in France.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my most important utilities was designing an ELF Dynamic Share Object DSO (i.e. an
<code>so</code> file) which had no export table which ostensibly eliminates the usefulness of a
DSO. I designed a low-level mechanism to load an encrypted export table relying upon ELF's
special <code>init</code> section which executes before the DSO is activated. The export table
is one of the major attack surfaces in a DSO.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with the 3rd party software supplier of the video codec in order to
substantially bolster the security of their product which proved to be a major potential
security hole in our system. The challenge was that most of their customers did not require the
security that we did, and for practical commercial reasons they were not willing to make a
separate build for us. I managed to architect an optional security plugin for them that caused
minimal changes to their system, and caused zero interference to their other customers who chose
not to use the plugin.</p></li>
<li><p>Initially the movie studios insisted that smartphones could not be rooted because it made
them considerable more difficult to debug, so I developed a fuzzy logic-like mechanism to detect
rootedness. The problem was that less expensive Android phones from Asia, that were flooding the
market, were rooted by default because it saved the manufacturer a few hours of licensing work
from Google who controlled AOSP (the Android Open Source Project). Therefore security had to be
moved from the client to the content servers. For example a license that license that played 100
hours of content a week was suspect, or a license that played content simultaneously from
different geographic locations was suspect.</p></li>

<span class="hilite">Novel Bioinformatics PCR Algorithms: software consultant</span>
</summary>
<p>The company's product was a novel <em>dry</em> test kit for <a
href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mrsa/symptoms-causes/syc-20375336">MRSA</a>
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a> amplification device). <em>MRSA</em> is a
lethal strain of <em>staphylococcus</em> bacteria. It thrives in hospitals where it is the major
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis">iatrogenic</a> killer of immunologically
compromised patients. Therefore it is critically important that hospitals identify carriers
among both patients and hospital staff as soon as they are infected. Most people who are
infected with <em>MRSA</em> carry it in their nasal passages. Most interesting such a person,
even an immunologically compromised one, can still live until 120. However if an immunogically
comprised person touches his nose, and afterwards touches an open wound then he is in danger of
death. Prior to <em>PCR</em> technology, it took a laboratory about 48 hours to identify the
disease by growing a culture in a "gold standard" <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Petri dish</a>, but <em>PCR</em> technology can
make the identification within 2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Before joining the company I had zero background in biology, micro-biology, genetics,
or biochemistry.</strong> When I arrived the company was in imminent danger of closing down
their <em>PCR</em> business unit because their initial <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Drug_Administration">FDA</a> trials completely
failed that they had spent about $500K to prepare by taking 800 samples from a few Israeli
hospitals. The owner was "pulling his hair out" because he felt that his science was 100%
correct. First he hired <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tzachi-Bar">Tzachi Bar</a>
to consult, the inventor of PCR mathematical algorithms used in all PCR devices at that time
world wide, but <em>Bar</em> could not help him. I happened to be the owner's neighbor. He knew
that I was a computer scientist, so he took his final chance with me. <strong>Within 3 months I
made a number of discoveries that validated the owner's science and enabled them to pass the
<em>FDA</em> trials.</strong> In spite of my technical success, for commercial reasons beyond
the scope of my short article, they were forced to close down their <em>PCR</em> business unit;
therefore my <a href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">threshold
algorithm</a> was never patented.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Initially <em>Bar</em> and the company's chief microbiologist gave me a 2 week crash
course in the fields of microbiology and genetics that they felt I would need for my
work.</p></li>
<li><p>My first task was to generate amplified graphs of all 800 samples, and to study them.
Note that every sample had a <em>PCR</em> result, and an associated "gold standard" <em>Petri
dish</em> result.</p></li>
<li><p>My second task was to carefully read the manual of the <em>PCR</em> device. I noted that
the company's junior biochemist who was responsible for administering the hospital tests had
used an incorrect protocol for configuring the <em>PCR</em> devices. The 3 control samples that
every batch contains were placed in incorrect test tube slots. Therefore all test results were
nonsensical!</p></li>
<li><p>Even though the samples had been thrown away weeks before I arrived, fortunately they had
saved the raw data from the <em>PCR</em> devices, that allowed me to reconstruct the
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm. The new results were better, but still hardly good enough for
the <em>FDA</em> that required 80% accuracy.</p></li>
<li><p>I noted that tests from the pure laboratory colonies of <em>MRSA</em>, with extremely
high concentrations never to be encountered in a patient sample, all failed. This indicated to
me that there was a flaw in the industry standard <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>And I noted that many tests with negative <em>PCR</em> results, in spite of the positive
Petri results, had random graphs instead of the smooth <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay">bioassay</a> sigmoidal shaped curve of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a> that
<em>Bar-Tichopad</em> expected. After discussing the matter with <em>Bar</em> and the senior
biochemist, this indicated that the graphs were statistically noisy due to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a>.
Therefore the company's preliminary chemistry did not yet filter out nasal impurities that
mature chemistry was supposed to do. Maybe we had to "throw in the towel", i.e. to give
up?</p></li>
<li><p>So I put on my "thinking cap", and discovered a completely new algorithm that was much
better than the Bar-Tsichopad algorithm.</p></li>
<li><p>I discovered a much more accurate and simple way to normalize the bioassay curve and to
remove systematic noise, by noting that the "systematic" noise and the linear rise in the signal
of the negative control sample precisely matched the patient samples (from the same batch).
Therefore my simple normalization solution was to subtract the negative control sample from the
patient samples.</p></li>
<li><p>Both <em>Bar</em> and the senior biochemist agreed with me that inhibition never
increases the <em>PCR</em> signal. Therefore I used an alternative <a
href="https://www.pythonprog.com/thresholding-in-machine-learning/">AI threshold test</a>,
instead of the <em>Bar-Tichopad</em> test that was based upon advanced mathematical functional
analysis to calculate the <a
href="https://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/real-time-pcr-learning-center/real-time-pcr-basics/real-time-pcr-understanding-ct.html">Ct</a>
of the assay.</p></li>
<li><p>I split the patient samples in half. For the control half, I used the single maximum
signal from each sample. I recorded minimum PCR signal that indicated a positive Petri result.
And similarly I recorded the maximum PCR signal indicated a negative Petri result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>I used the other half of the patient samples to test my new threshold algorithm.
My predictions were 95% accurate in spite of the high degree of inhibition found in the
preliminary chemistry!</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The explanation for the minor inaccuracy was some results were in the "gray" region where
there was an overlap between the minimum PCR signal to indicate a positive result, and the
maximum PCR signal to indicate a negative result.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>My threshold algorithm won a MRSA "shoot out" at the world famous UK <a
href="https://www.stgeorges.nhs.uk/">St Georges medical school hospital</a> against competing
PCR kits from the huge international pharmaceutical companies!</strong></p></li>

Internet TV Cybersecurity: software researcher
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>Most of my work at NDS was doing software security research including occasional code
security audits.</p></li>
<li><p>I was one of the first security researchers in the world to prove that the ubiquitous
virtual machine packages, e.g. VMWare and VirtualBox, could break simple DRM protection schemes
like date restrictions or replay count.</p></li>
<li><p>I showed how X64 virtualization hardware could be used together with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QEMU">QEMU</a> to break the software random number generator
(RNG). This was a very critical attack because the fundamental security assumption was that each
client PC had a world wide unique cryptrographic "nonce". But if confederate clients could share
their nonces then a single license could be shared by all members of the confederacy. At that
time, c. 2007, the cycle counter instruction <code>RDTSC</code> was easily subverted by the
virtualization technology. After I left the company, since 2012 the CPU has a hardware RNG
instruction <code>RDRAND</code> which is a much safer instruction from the perspective of
security.</p></li>
<li><p>I invited outside security researchers to give lectures and seminars to in-house
developers on state-of-the-art security techniques. Based upon these lectures I developed an
obfuscated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>-like
compiler that was extremely difficult to reverse engineer.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2007 NDS was invited by the Chinese government TV system to protect the 2008 Beijing
Olympics TV feed. I "almost" won the contract. The Chinese government did not want Microsoft to
be involved in the bidding because nearly 100% of servers and client PCs had stolen operating
system licenses which could easily be revealed when Microsoft installed the protection software.
At time the Olympic TV feed was owned by Microsoft company MSNBC. Eventually Microsoft agreed
not to sue China for the stolen operating system licenses, and they offered the protection
package for free so they won the contract.</p></li>
<li><p>The Israeli cable TV operators had their feed stolen by Israeli expats in the US, and
more massively in the Palestinian areas. I showed how to it was possible to easily technically
stop these thefts. For reasons that are still not clear to me, the operators showed no interest
in stopping the thefts.</p></li>
<li><p>My first job at NDS was as a contractor. I built a tester and simulator for the NDS
satellite software. I designed a DSL (domain specific language) in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> to do this task. After my analysis of their
software, I concluded that there were critical flaws in the design. I was quite knowledgeable in
VAX/VMS O/S internals. The junior VP in charge of the project refused to believe that a mere QA
guy could have such knowledge, so I built a graduated test program that blew his (virtual)
satellite out of the sky. Afterwards my software was installed on every developer's desktop.
Before checking in software into their version control system, it became standard operating
procedure to run a 10 minute test prior to check-in.</p></li>
<li><p>I worked with the QA department to analyze their bug reports, and concluded that nearly
50% of their software effort was bug fixes. And they had more than 1000 software developers! I
worked with the QA department in order to implement a program to greatly reduce bugs. I recall
that their biggest problem was lazy software builds that often contained tens of thousands of
warnings. My most important improvement was insisting on zero warnings, or adding explicit
compiler approval of any warning to be explicitly allowed.</p></li>

<ol>
<li><p>I designed an extremely efficient network testing laboratory.</p></li>
<li><p>By selecting 24-port programmable layer-2 switches for each of the PC's 4x100 MB Ethernet
ports, each PC was able to control 96 cable modems during low speed ping tests, whereas
previously each PC could only control 4 modems (i.e. one per Ethernet port), which resulted in
massive (24x) cost savings through the reduction of PCs and their associated electrical
infrastructure, floor space, and air conditioning.</p></li>
<li><p>For high speed testing at 8 MB per modem, each PC's Ethernet port could only support 12
modems; but the programmable switches could be dynamically configured to quickly open and close
ports.</p></li>
<li><p>I Implemented automated control of the lab in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of implementing speed tests with Cisco's network utilities which relied upon a
binary search algorithm, initially I wrote a program to implement a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_search_technique">Fibonacci search</a> which was a
significant improvement. Subsequently I wrote a <a

<span class="hilite">Blind Accessibility: VP R&amp;D</span>
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I invented a software system that allowed the blind to "see" and to understand computer
images, especially maps and mathematical functions, using a</p>
<p>a. standard PC or smartphone web browser</p>
<p>b. the device's builtin speaker</p>
<p>c. ideally a consumer grade graphics tablet and stylus (e.g. <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Wacom-Graphic-Drawing-Tablet-Beginners/dp/B07S1RR3FR">Wacom
Bamboo</a> ~$50)</p>
<p>d. although optionally, but less preferably, with the device's builtin mouse</p></li>
<li><p>The software heavily relied upon the builtin <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG">standard vector graphics (SVG)</a> capability of all
modern web browsers (since 1999).</p>
<p>a. <em>SVG</em> is an <em>XML</em> variant.</p>
<p>b. <em>SVG</em> returns the postion and color at the cursor.</p>
<p>c. Unlike <em>JPG</em> or <em>PNG</em> pixelated images, <em>SVG</em> has the ability to
smoothly zoom in or zoom out of vector images.</p></li>
<li><p>The basic concept can be understood by using an example image of a circle.</p>
<p>a. Let the display be black, except for the perimeter of the circle which is a few pixels
wide and which is colored white.</p>
<p>b. In the simple case where the user's stylus hovers over a white pixel, a sound is played,
but hovering over a black pixel yields no sound.</p>
<p>c. Blind users prefer a graphics tablet to a mouse because blind users still have hand-eye
(or actually mind-eye) coordination, so they can easy navigate around the tablet. Mice have the
problem that the cursor gets stuck at the edge of the display when you scroll beyond the edge.
It is possible to provide sonic cues to ameliorate this problem, but using a tablet and stylus
is much easier.</p>
<p>d. Divide the screen into a grid of 96x96 rectangles, or equivalently 8x8 12-tone chromatic
octaves. Let the horizontal (x) axis be represented by a piano, and the vertical (y) axis be
represented by a flute. Instead of playing the same sound for all white pixel positions, play
the xy note combination in the grid position where the cursor is located.</p>
<p>e. If we would use two intersecting circles, say one white and blue, we could use different
instrument combinations to represent the colors, and/or we could use the keyboard or click on
the stylus to query which circle we are touching, where the application will provide a
text-to-speech response.</p></li>
<li><p>Images need to be prepared offline. But in the case of maps, most of which are already
designed using <em>XML</em>, it is possible to programmatically automate their
preparation.</p></li>

<span class="hilite">Public interest intervenor-economist in the ECAP77 hearings on marginal
cost pricing for electricity</span>
</summary>
<ol>
<li><p>I was the first public interest <a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intervenor">intervenor</a> in the history of
the <em>OEB</em> to be awarded costs - at the suggestion of the <em>OEB</em>!</p></li>
<li><p>Due to intense political pressure from the mineral smelting industry who relied upon
subsidized electricity prices, the Ontario government forced the the public electric utility,
then called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontario_Hydro">Ontario Hydro</a>, to withdraw
their case after the hearings had already begun. I became the primary intervenor at the hearings
to present the case for <a
href="https://www.britannica.com/money/marginal-cost-pricing">marginal cost
pricing</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I published a full page op-ed about the hearings in Canada's then newspaper of record <a
href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>I initially learned about the hearings from a course in my MBA program (1976) when I
complained to the Ontario Hydro economic team (beside the Univ campus) about the mediocre
<em>B</em> grade my professor gave me on my term paper.</p></li>
<li><p>I had legal standing because I paid an electric bill of about $25 a month!</p></li>
<li><p>This job was a formative learning experience for me that subsequently effected my whole
life because I learned that a single individual could effectively stand up to the corruption of
large business and government. With perfect hindsight, it was clearly a case of Divine
intervention (Hebrew: <em>Hashgacha Pratit</em>). Subsequently in Israel I became involved in <a
href="#community-service">community service</a> projects, described below, where I
<em>successfully</em> stood my ground against government corruption.</p></li>

<h3><span class="hilite">1. Crypto: Adler-32 Checksum Redux</span></h3>
<p>Two commonly used <em>non-cryptographic</em> checksum algorithms are <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adler-32">Adler-32</a> and <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation_of_cyclic_redundancy_checks#CRC-32_algorithm">CRC-32</a>.
Adler-32 is trivial and much faster to calculate on account of the simplicity of its main
loop.</p>

<p>Unlike CRC-32, the major flaw with Adler-32 is its lack of "spread" in the domain of
<code>sum</code>. Clearly short messages will have too small a spread, which results in many
collisions. However it is very easy to correct this problem by using a constant multiplier
<code>k</code> which is a function of <code>n</code>. We still retain the speed and simplicity
of the original algorithm. This algorithm is quite useful as an extremely fast
<em>non-cryptographic</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hash

<li>adler64: use 64-bit arithmetic that allows for a maximum byte array length of ~28K</li>
<li>use a wider <code>uint32_t</code> array which speeds up the calculation by a factor of
4</li>

<h3><span class="hilite">2. Crypto: Lightweight Key Wrapper</span></h3>
<p>This algorithm wraps a 32-bit number with a 64-bit key and a pseudo-random 32-bit number; and
where the ALU can process 128-bit numbers then we can wrap a 64-bit number with a 128-bit key
and a pseudo-random 64-bit number. The random number can be generated on-the-fly in a local
random number generator. The algorithm is extremely fast. It is implemented in a few assembly
instructions. It can be executed <code>inline</code>. Therefore it is quite useful for
obfuscation.</p>

<h3><span class="hilite">3. Crypto: <em>Invertible</em> "Cross Hamming Weight"
Transformation</span></h3>
<p>Rotating a number by its Hamming weight is a cryptographically weak transformation because
(1) the transformation does not change the original Hamming weight, and (2) Hamming weights have
a binomial distribution where the weight has an extremely high probability of being in the
center of the distribution.</p>
<p>This simple invention improves these flaws. The transformation flattens the distribution by
(1) making the upper and lower half of the number into 2 adjacent <code>N/2</code>-bit binomial
distributions, and (2) 75% of the time it changes the original Hamming weight. And it is
possible to apply the transformation twice, where the result is 4 adjacent <code>N/4</code>-bit
binomial distributions.</p>
<p>The algorithm is implemented as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The original number is split in half into its lower bits and upper bits. Both Hamming
weights are calculated.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be <a
href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bitwise-complement-operator-tilde/">bit-wise
complemented</a> when the Hamming weight of the upper bits is <em>even</em> , while the upper
bits will be complemented when the Hamming weight of the lower bits is <em>odd</em>. Note that
the complement operation is invertible because it does not change parity.</p></li>
<li><p>The lower bits will be rotated by the original Hamming weight of the upper bits, and
<em>vice versa</em>. Similarly the rotation operation is invertible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Most modern CPUs have a Hamming weight (aka <code>popcount</code>) instruction, therefore the
run-time overhead of using this transformation is negligible.</p>
<p>The transformation is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function">invertible</a>. After applying it to a
trivial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">LCG PRNG</a> which
is cryptographically very weak, the industry standard <a
href="https://www.pcg-random.org/posts/how-to-test-with-practrand.html">PractRand</a> analysis
shows the result to be as good as the highest quality PRNGs commonly used today. This

<p>This algorithm calculates a value in the same range as classic Hamming weights, but the
distribution is "nearly" uniformly distributed except for minor perturbations. For example a
32-bit number returns a value in the range [0,32]. The algorithm is highly non-linear, i.e.
cryptographically "bent".</p>
<ol>
<li><code>WIDTH</code> is the bit width of the domain of <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We successively squeeze <code>x</code> by dividing it into 2-bit width groups, 4-bit width
groups, 8-bit width groups, etc., where the maximum width is <code>WIDTH/4</code>.</li>
<li>We calculate the classical Hamming weight of each squeezed <code>x</code>.</li>
<li>We use their weighted sums, where the weight is the width, modulo <code>WIDTH+1</code> to
calculate the FFT Hamming weight.</li>

<h3><span class="hilite">5. Container: Binary Expandable Hash Table</span></h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Typically the maximum number of entries in a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> is a <em>prime number</em>, while
my algorithm uses <code>2**N</code> entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically when expanding the size of a hash table, all entries must be rehashed, while my
algorithm does not require any rehashing.</p></li>
<li><p>Typically hash tables are "sparse", i.e. they contain a lot of empty entries, because the
same data structure is used to store both the data associated with the keys, and to
search/update keys. My algorithm uses two separate data structures which greatly minimizes
sparseness. One structure defines the maximum number of keys, while the second structure defines
the maximum number of data entries.</p></li>
<li><p>Where the operating system supports the <em>Linux</em> <code>vmalloc</code> or the
<em>Win32</em> <code>VirtualAlloc</code> allocators, then it is possible to allocate large
memory regions with virtually linear address spaces but are composed of physically
non-contiguous pages. My algorithm can take advantage of these allocators to further reduce
sparseness, and not to move the data associated with existing keys when the table is
expanded.</p></li>

<h3><span class="hilite">6. Embedded Systems: Dynamically Loadable FLASH Configuration Files
Larger Than RAM</span></h3>
<p>On embedded systems with limited RAM, it is not possible to load large configuration files
into RAM, and it is normally a security risk to parse the configuration file when dynamically
loading it regardless of its size. My invention allows the use of an off-line
<em>pre-parsed</em> configuration file into object data format <em>without any executable
code</em>. It can be dynamically loaded into FLASH memory at an address defined at load time
where (1) the system architect must have mapped the FLASH memory accordingly, (2) the <em>C</em>
structure of object file must be recognized by the control program, and (3) it is extremely
difficult (although not impossible) to modify the configuration for the duration of the
load.</p>
<p>The format can be designed to support variable sized memory regions in a way that can be
legally supported by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C">Misra C</a> mandated
rules for safe programming design in industries such as automotive, aircraft, and medical
equipment, etc. Normally <em>Misra C</em> forbids the use of variable sized data structures. For
example, <em>Misra C</em> rules normally force developers to allocate space for sparse arrays,
so that an array of file names would require enough space in each array element to support the
longest possible file name. However my invention enables the array elements to be stored in a
packed heap in FLASH, so that each array element is a pointer into the heap.</p>
<p>I show how the off-line pre-parser can be implemented without any executable <em>C</em> code
by taking advantage of the GCC's <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Designated-Inits.html">designated initializer</a>
feature along with <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Jinja2</a>

<h3><span class="hilite">8. Accessibility: Generic Dyslexic Font</span></h3>
<p>I invented a scheme to modify existing fonts so that a dyslexic can easily read them by
mimicking the concept how computer vision programs can decipher <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code">QR codes</a> regardless of how they are rotated.
You should note that in QR codes there are 3 solid black squares in the top-left, top-right, and
bottom-left corners, but not in the bottom-right corner. My invention pads the the left and
right margins of each character in the font, allowing space for two vertical strips in each
margin. Each character will have the same size padding. In the middle of the inner left strip, I
add a diacritical dot. Now the dyslexic reader needs to follow a single rule, namely to note
that a validly oriented character has a dot in its inner left margin. The margins have to be
wide enough, so that the reader can recognize the spacing between a sequence of characters.</p>

<p>In the <em>Torah</em> in <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm">Gen. 18:19</a>
(Hebrew: <em>Parshat Vayeira</em>), <em>HaShem</em> (English: the Jewish name of God) states
that the reason why He chose <em>Avraham Avinu</em> (English: our forefather Abraham) and his
descendants to be His vanguard in this world is because "he [Avraham] will command his children
and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD, to do righteousness and justice"<a
href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>. According to
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nechama_Leibowitz">Nechama Leibowitz</a>, the modern
biblical commentator <em>par excellance</em>, this is <em>HaShem</em>'s "prime directive" to the
Jewish People. I would like to believe that I have attempted to internalize this directive. My
attempts will be what my family and friends will remember me for, and hopefully emulate, but
hardly my contributions to computer science.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>1995-96: I successfully fought the IDF eventually at the Supreme Court over their illegal
"Oslo" rules of engagement that would require that IDF soldiers not respond to Palestinian
threats at gunpoint, even from known terrorist murderers, until <strong>after</strong> the Pals
first fired at them!</p>
<ul>
<li><details>
<summary>

</summary>
In 1995 I initially received these orders at an <em>impromptu</em> visit in the field from then
Major General, <em>Ilan Biran</em>, where I vigorously argued with him. The sycophantic general
also said that he felt Oslo would usher in an era of peace that would reduce the need for any
IDF presence along the Jordanian border, at the exact same time that the so-called "suicide" bus
bombing campaign was in full swing in Israeli cities! At the time I was a corporal. Afterwards I
wrote the general an official letter of complaint to which his bureau responded that I had "wax
in my ears" in which they clarified why such an order <em>would have been</em> patently illegal.
A year later I received the exact same orders at a meeting of brigade officers under the command
of then Major General <em>Uzi Dyan</em>, <em>Biran's</em> successor. I anticipated such an
order, so I took the letter with me. When the brigade (Hebrew: <em>Hativa</em>) commander, a
colonel, started spewing his nonsense, I jumped up waving the letter from his predecessor why
his orders were patently illegal. His jaw dropped.
<p>
I had already prepared my petition to the Supreme Court which I instructed my attorney to file
that very same day. On the next day the army sent a brigadier general (Hebrew: <em>Tat
Aluf</em>) to interview me, a corporal, about my objections. The brigadier didn't deal with the
substance of my objections. Instead he claimed that I would cause WW III, and according to
script he threw me out of the army - for the the rest of my reserve duty that season. From home,
I immediately started to give interviews to the media. Soon I received a telephone call from my
regiment's (Hebrew: <em>Gdud</em>) sergeant major who sternly warned me that soldiers in uniform
were not permitted to speak with the media. When I reminded him that the army threw me out, he
burst out laughing.
</p>
<p>
In court the response of the Attorney General and the IDF Adjutant General audaciously claimed
that they never issued any such order. (Note that such a bald lie in a legal deposition is
normally a very serious criminal offense, unless you happen to be the Attorney General). I
brought affidavits from other soldiers, and it was obvious that thousands of other soldiers who
heard this ridiculous order were seething too. The court agreed that such an order would be
illegal, while the court accepted the IDF's lame excuse that it would be inconceivable that such
outrageoulsy illegal orders could ever have been issued by these illustrious generals. Is it
surprising that the presiding judge on the panel who accepted this charade was none other than
then Chief "Justice" Aharon Barak who presided over this travesty of justice held "behind closed
doors" under the rubric of "military security" in order to keep the IDF General Staff's
depravity<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> and
sycophancy hidden from the general public?

<li><p>2017-20: I successfully fought the Ministry of Social Services at Jerusalem family court
over their attempt to force the adoption of the three young children of my wife's cousin, where
the Social Services' youth officer and their legal guardian, who the youth officer appointed,
were engaged in criminal malfeasance. They argued against giving the father custody because they
falsely accused him of sexually molesting one of his daughters, while the mother was mentally
unstable. I proved that they had perjured themselves when in fact they were aware that other
children had molested the girl on multiple occasions when she was held in locked-down youth
facilities administered by Social Services.</p>
<ul>
<li><details>
<summary>
Details
</summary>
The key to winning the case was that I instructed the father to secretly record a revealing
conversation with the naive junior social worker who was responsible for the daily care of his
children in the institution. After receiving a stern warning following a visit from the young
girl's grandfather, a retired social worker from the US black ghettos where child molestation
was endemic, she felt obligated to install observation carmeras. She admitted to the father that
she caught the molester on camera, and that she was aware about the previous molestation
incidents in the other institution. And she described how when she brought the then 5 year-old
girl to be treated by the institution's psychologist, he started treatment by using the
conventional technique of giving a male doll to the little girl in order for her to gently
describe what happened. Instead she astounded him by attempting to illustrate by pulling down
the zipper of the psychologist! Of course the psychologist, the legal guardian, and their boss -
the youth officer, denied everything. Unfortunately the family court judge regularly worked with
these professional colleagues; therefore he refused to have them indicted for perjury, but he
did eventually order that the children be released to the custody of their father primarily on
the basis of the recordings.

<li><p>2022: I successfully fought the Ministry of Education over their attempt to force an
exceptionally bright autistic teenager to attend a school for emotionally retarded teens, or
else face truancy charges. They supplied him with a "confederate" aid who sabotaged him while he
attended school, and abandoned him during COVID home schooling. I proved my case by having the
child evaluated at the world-renowned <a href="https://feuerstein-institute.org/">Feuerstein
Institute</a> who declared that he was indeed exceptionally bright.</p></li>
<li><p>2022: My wife and I took in a poor homeless Russian refugee family into our home for 4

On the street in my neighborhood I befriended a leaker (who today still wishes to remain
anonymous) who worked in then Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin's office. The leaker complained
that he was ashamed of his work. He was preparing the groundwork for the Oslo Accords. I
convinced him to share his information with those who may be able to stop the Accords. His legal
"ground rules" for sharing were never to reveal any government documents in order to have the
cover of "plausible deniability". Therefore all the information that I shared was obtained
orally. In spite of lack of documentation, his <em>bona fides</em> soon became clear. I
published a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samizdat">samizdat</a>, i.e. an underground
newsletter as this was before the era of the Internet. My main distribution point was <a
href="https://shorashimshop.com/blog/author/moshe/">Moshe Kempinski's</a> <a
href="https://shorashimshop.com/shop/">Shorashim Gift Shop</a> in the Old City of Jerusalem.
<p>
I shared his information with <a href="https://womeningreen.org/about-us/">Ruth Matar o.b.m.</a>
founder of <em>Women In Green</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Elon">Rav
Benny Alon o.b.m.</a> co-founder of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feiglin">Zu

Shalom Gold o.b.m.</a>, along with many others. I introduced him to <a
href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/author/steve-rodan/?anchor=about-me">Steve Rodan</a> then
diplomatic reporter for the <a href="https://www.jpost.com/">Jerusalem Post</a>. After
thoroughly investigating the leaker's claims, in December 1993 Rodan wrote an exposé in the
<em>Jerusalem Post</em> about the true intentions of the Accords, namely to unconditionally
grant Arafat a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> Palestinian state
regardless of the fraudulent obligations that Peres claimed Arafat agreed to undertake.
Unfortunately most of Rodan's professional colleagues considered him to be "off of his rocker".
He was forced to resign from the <em>Jerusalem Post</em>. It took almost 7 years for some to
finally issue a <a href="https://jewishworldreview.com/cols/tobin062200.asp">mea culpa</a>.
</p>
<p>
I received advice from <em>Yossi Ben-Aharon</em>, former Director General of the Prime
Minister's Office of <em>Yitzhak Shamir</em>, on "spy craft" in order to keep "under the radar".
I took on the <em>nom de guerre</em> "Avraham Yehuda", i.e. the full name given to me at my
<em>Brit Milah</em>. I acted as the leaker's secret spokesman to the press, to opposition
<em>MKs</em> (i.e. <em>Knesset</em> members), and to other influential people. Finally the
majority of sentient Jewish Israelis can now (2025) recognize that there was a direct line of
causality from the insanity and treachery of the Oslo Accords, to the so-called Gaza
"Disengagement", to the Shalit prisoner exchange, and finally to the Hamas massacre on Simchat
Torah 5784, i.e. on October 7 2023.
</p>
</details></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The majority of sentient Jewish Israelis can now (2025) accept my key takeaway from the Oslo
Accords, namely the architects of Oslo, Peres and Beilin, <em>designed it to fail</em>!
<ul>
<li><details>
<summary>
Details
</summary>
Peres had secretly promised the incorrigible arch-terrorist Arafat a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> state within a year knowing that he
would never adhere to the provisions of the Accords that they proudly presented to the Knesset
(comprised of Arabs, communists, and bribed Jewish members that still only gave them a razor
thin 61-59 majority) and to the gullible Israeli public (incited by the left wing news media).
<p>
The <em>Knesset</em> was too slow in delivering Peres' promise, so Arafat began his murderous
tantrum to "convince" them to move faster - aka the second Intifada. Initially Arafat attacked
the so-called "settlers" who the leftist government abandoned. But they resisted and refused to
flee, in spite of the government's expectations to the contrary; so Arafat terrorized Israel's
soft underbelly, i.e. inside the "sacred" Green Line, in particular his "suicide" bus bombing
campaign.
</p>
<p>
The government had arranged the Baruch Goldstein massacre.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> Beilin fully expected that it would lead to the
expulsion of the Jewish community in Hevron, and thus break the settlers' resistance, but the
expulsion never happened because then PM Rabin was afraid of an army revolt, so Arafat went
berserk. No one alive at that time can ever forget how Peres referred to the victims of Arafat's
bus bombings as "sacrifices for peace" as the streets were literally flowing with their blood,
while he hysterically shrieked that "nothing could ever stop the peace process" (because it was
his road to amassing a fortune). A bus blew up in Jerusalem in front of my son just before his
wedding day. He entered the bus in order to try to save some of the victims. He came home
drenched in blood.
</p>
</details></li>
</ul></li>
<li>My most successful personal act against Oslo was preventing Arafat's May 1994 attempt to
ascend <em>Har HaBayit</em> (English: the Temple Mount). Arafat desperately wanted to
triumphantly ascend <em>Har HaBayit</em> just like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Jerusalem_(1187)">Saladin</a> did in 1187 CE.
<ul>
<li><details>
<summary>

</summary>
Peres agreed, and it was Beilin's job to make it happen. I was in regular contact with
<em>Yaakov Novik</em> who organized the anti-Oslo demonstrations. We made sure that the police
were aware that Novik intended to stage a massive demonstration of hundreds of thousands to
prevent Arafat's ascent. The police were terrified that Jewish demonstrators would enter
<em>East Jerusalem</em> and directly confront Arab demonstrators, so the police nixed Beilin's
plan.
<p>
The leaker informed me that Beilin countered that he would schedule the ascent for <em>Erev
Shabbat</em> (English: Friday night) in the hope that the mostly religious Jewish demonstrators
would not show up. And the leaker said that Beilin secretly <strong>ordered</strong> former
Sephardi Chief Rabbi <em>Ovadiah Yosef</em> to issue a <em>Halachic</em> (English: Jewish legal)
decision that it would be <em>forbidden</em> for Jewish demonstrators to show up because it
would force the police to mobilize thousands of policemen, many of whom were religious.
<em>Yosef</em>, who at that time was the spiritual leader of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shas">Shas</a> political party that was a critical member
Peres' coalition government, agreed because many <em>Shas</em> <em>MKs</em> (i.e.
<em>Knesset</em> members) were being blackmailed by the so-called "legal system" with criminal
indictments if they did not kowtow to government diktats. (Eventually when their usefulness
expired, many were indicted anyway including party leader <em>Aryeh Deri</em> who was imprisoned
for two years). I immediately informed former Ashkenazi Chief Rabbi <em>Shlomo Goren</em> of
what his nemesis <em>Yosef</em> intended to do. <em>Goren</em> went berserk. He issued a counter
<em>Halachic</em> decision that it would be <em>obligatory</em> to violate Shabbat to prevent
the mass terrorist murderer Arafat from ascending <em>Har HaBayit</em>, so Beilin and the police
were forced to fold. As a consolation prize, Beilin arranged for Arafat to secretly and ignobly
ascend dressed as an old woman!

<h4>Brief History Of The Oslo Accords</h4>
<p>The following is my very brief synopsis of the perfidy of the Oslo architects that the
majority now (2025) recognize laid the groundwork for the October 7 Hamas massacre. Almost of
all of my synopsis is based upon verifiable open source material, but my skepticism was refined
by the education that the leaker gave me into the extent of government corruption. Today (2025)
many are too young, or not yet born, to remember the sordid details of Oslo, and unfortunately
many are afflicted with the "politically correct" reverence for the man who was primarily
responsible.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Unlike the rest of the modern State of Israel's "founding fathers" who were frustrated
Bolsheviks, but at least had their primary education in a "Cheider", i.e. a religious Jewish
primary school, while Peres' primary education was in a Jesuit school in Poland. As the visceral
antisemite "Saint" Ignatius, the founder the Jesuit order, boasted "give me a boy until the age
of 7, and I will give you the man". Peres, was regularly in league with the Vatican, see <a
href="https://www.haaretz.com/2003-07-22/ty-article/peres-suggests-holy-sites-in-jlem-be-declared-world-capital/0000017f-e0d3-d38f-a57f-e6d376ac0000">here</a>

He unsuccessfully secretly attempted to revive the Vatican's 1947 "wet dream", see <a
href="https://israelbehindthenews.com/1997/09/22/the-vaticans-jerusalem-agenda/">here</a> and <a
href="https://www.redmoonrising.com/chamish/vaticanagenda.htm">here</a>, to declare the Old City
of Jerusalem as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corpus_separatum_(Jerusalem)">corpus
separatum</a>. <em>Pope Paul VI</em> made <em>hollow</em> declarations of Jewish reconciliation
in his 1965 <em>Nostra Aetate</em> encyclical. Paul <em>and his successors</em> could <a
href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/343072">never theologically accept the
reestablishment of a modern Jewish State</a>. In spite of the pablum in <em>Nostra Aetate</em>,
according to two millennia of fundamental Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox antisemitic
beliefs originating with the New Testament Gospels, the Jews were damned to be a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew">wandering people</a> for refusing to accept
Jesus as their messianic savior - aka replacement theology or supersessionism.
<p>
And it speaks volumes that the second largest <em>Apostolic</em> (i.e. diplomatic) delegation to
the Vatican is from Iran who openly declares that it is their God-given duty to annihilate the
Jewish State in order to hasten the coming of their false messiah, i.e. the <em>Machdi</em>.
Iran has a minuscule Christian community, while converting to Christianity carries a death
penalty. Can we assume that their theologians have discussions about <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_many_angels_can_dance_on_the_head_of_a_pin%3F">how many
angels can dance on the head of a pin</a>? As <em>Stalin</em> quipped at <em>Yalta</em> in 1945,
the Vatican no longer has any divisions; but they do have world wide "moral legitimacy", while
the Iranians have many divisions but no legitimacy. Together they make a lethal antisemitic duo.

<li><p>The <em>Peres Center "For Peace"</em> had almost nothing to do with peace. In fact it was
a <a href="https://carolineglick.com/the_peace_profiteers/">profiteering operation</a> that
turned Peres into one of the wealthiest men in Israel by skimming funds that enabled the
dictatorial and kleptomaniacal Arafat, and his successor Abbas, to become multi-billionaires.
Peres used his international "prestige" to <a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/shill">shill</a> for billions of dollars from
international donors and gullible US Jewish donors to fund projects which Arafat simply pocketed
and for which the Peres <em>et al</em> received substantial commissions. The <em>Peres
Center</em> established Arafat's core monopolies (e.g. mobile communications, and petrol) that
Arafat either personally owned or controlled, of course for which the <em>Peres Center</em>
received huge commissions.</p>

The <em>Peres Center</em> secretly awarded a $100K prize to Norwegian diplomats <a
href="https://carolineglick.com/the_peres_center_scandal/">Terje Larson and his wife Mona
Juul</a> who were highly influential sponsors of Peres' Nobel Prize bid. The ceremony had to be
kept secret because Larson had the ignoble fame of being one of the tiny number of Western
diplomats to ever be considered <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persona_non_grata">persona non grata</a> by the Israeli
government. Peres was an equal partner with "birds of a feather" Arafat and Martin Schlaff<a
href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (who made his
initial fortune <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Schlaff">collaborating with the
East Germany's <em>Stassi</em> secret police</a>) in the lucrative <em>Jericho Oasis
Casino</em>. Israel's then Attorney General <em>Elyakim Rubinstein</em> obligingly rezoned the
casino out of <a
href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/west-bank-areas-a-b-and-c-how-were-they-created/">Area
B</a> in order to enable Israelis to "legally" play who were its main clientele.
</details></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Peres was able to co-opt his opportunistic Israeli supporters by giving them a small
piece of the action - either via outright cash bribes, but usually via a "soft bribe" of
professional advancement in highly lucrative jobs that were directly or indirectly controlled by
the Israeli government.</p></li>
<li><p>Already in 1993, Peres immediately launched his first major Oslo graft scheme. Then
Foreign Minister Peres convinced the government to transfer Israeli tax rebates intended for the
PA Treasury directly to Arafat's personal bank account in Tel Aviv. The then future directors of
the <em>Peres Center</em> transferred these funds to <a
href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/former-israeli-peace-envoys-charged-with-money-transfers-to-arafat">Arafat's
personal Swiss bank account</a>, of course for a substantial commission.</p>
<ul>
<li><details>

</summary>
When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adir_Zik">Adir Zik</a> publicized the scheme in his
wildly popular "illegal" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arutz_Sheva">Arutz-7</a> radio
broadcasts, Peres was forced to respond that Arafat needed a "war chest" to fight Hamas who
Peres and Rabin dubbed as "the real enemies of the peace, <em>along with the Jewish
settlers</em>". It was a bald lie that the gullible public swallowed. Arafat never fought
against Hamas. In fact he often hired Hamasniks as "false flag contractors" for the suicide bus
bombing campaign that he orchestrated.
<p>
With US aid, the government openly provided thousands of standard assault rifles to Arafat's
forces in order "to fight Hamas". Many of these weapons were ballistically proven to have been
used to murder Jews.
</p>
<p>
And more sinister, the government invited the CIA to give Arafat's forces sniper training
courses "to fight Hamas". Again these weapons were ballistically proven to be used to
assassinate influential "settlers". The leaker claims that the government selected the targets
and supplied the Pals with the intelligence required to implement the assassinations. Since the
Pals pulled the triggers under CIA guidance, then it provided the government with unimpeachable
deniability.
</p>
</details></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Israeli intelligence was always aware of this deception but refused to publicize it. The
IDF and the <em>Shabak</em> electronically intercepted all of Arafat's communications. They had
a major military base which overlooked Arafat's Ramallah headquarters. They had spies on the
ground. In response to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_massacre">2002
Netanya Park Hotel Pesach Massacre</a> then PM Ariel Sharon <em>temporarily</em> stopped this
deception until he was blackmailed<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>8</sup></a> by the so-called "legal system" into advocating the
so-called "Disengagement" from Gaza. In the IDF's subsequent <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Defensive_Shield">Defensive Shield</a> campaign,
they captured and revealed hundreds of <a
href="https://www.gov.il/en/pages/the-involvement-of-arafat-pa-senior-officials-in-terrorism">documents</a>
that proved Arafat micro-managed nearly every single attack since he first signed the Oslo
Accords. Yet, until today (2025), in spite of the overwhelming evidence that Oslo was a sham,
subsequent Israeli governments refused, or were afraid of US pressure, to declare the Accords
null and void just as <a href="#beilin">Beilin</a> had predicted.</p></li>
<li><p>While Peres was a minister in successive Israeli governments from 1999-2007, he amassed a
fortune in Palestinian investments, while the <em>Knesset</em> "Ethics" committee should have
sanctioned him for egregious violations of conflict of interests<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>, but they incessantly
refused. However they did eventually force him to <a
href="http://israelvisit.co.il/BehindTheNews/Archives/Apr-22-05.htm">divest</a> prior to the
leftist <em>Knesset</em> electing him to Israel's presidency in 2007, when my friend and
colleague <a href="https://israelbehindthenews.com/">David Bedein</a> loudly publicized the
matter.</p></li>
<li><p>At Peres' funeral in 2014, most Israelis and the leaders of the Western world reverently
referred to him as a "prince of peace". Today most sentient Jewish Israelis finally understand
that the Oslo Accords and Gaza Disengagement policies that he championed were the root cause of
the October 7 Hamas massacre.</p></li>
<li><p><a id="beilin"/>The leaker heard Beilin, who was Peres' Deputy Foreign Minister, brag to
his confidants how he designed Oslo to be the perfect diplomatic trap. He compared it to a
runaway train. Beilin, with a doctorate in political science, was aware that Western countries,
and in particular the United States (at least until the second Trump Administration), would
never accept Israel canceling the Accords in spite of the Pals' fundamental egregious breaches.
(See the 2012 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1XrXXyQX0A">Hebrew TV debate</a> between
Beilin and Bennett, just before former PM <em>Naftali Bennett</em> first entered the Knesset,
where Beilin lectures Bennett like a sophomore how it would be diplomatically impossible for
future Israeli governments to ever cancel the Oslo Accords). Up until now (2025) Beilin's
predictions have been 100% correct for the past 30 years.</p></li>
<li><p>The results of Oslo from 1993 until the October 7 2023 Hamas massacre and its aftermath
has been thousands who have been murdered, maimed, widowed, and orphaned. Those responsible
especially MKs who voted for these policies along with senior members of the legal and security
establishment who enforced these policies must be made to pay financially for their crimes; and
they should be exiled (like in ancient Greece) or be forced to live in internal exile within 10
km of the Gaza or Lebanese borders. A special tribunal should be established with supreme
authority. Arguing that they could never have expected these events to happen is a lame excuse.
Arafat and his successors and Hamas have always openly stated what their true murderous
intentions were. They chose to ignore them due to the mainly soft bribes of career advancement
from Peres and his ilk.</p></li>

along with a prominent distorted visible email address watermark. This digital "camouflage" will
defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson
has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1)
Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be digitally
compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a

(2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying
my photo while attempting to associate it with any other person besides me. Similarly if a site
were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association with
them then it would be trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to challenge the
site by asking me for a verification email. And it would be interesting to consider adding an <a

would fool Photoshop software along with high quality printers and scanners into believing that
the watermarked photo is a banknote in order to prevent it from being manipulated or printed.
The general field of obscuring personal information is referred to as <a

<li id="fn2"><p><strong>Autodidact Polymath:</strong> There is a common misconception that only
geniuses like <em>Leonardo da Vinci</em> deserve the appellation autodidact polymath, and
therefore by referring to myself as one then I am making the bombastic claim to be a genius in
the same category as Leonardo. There is an outstanding <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGF3kjgCaMQ">TED talk</a> showing how children from Indian
slums with the appropriate mentoring can become <em>autodidact polymaths</em>. And there was a
similarly successful project done with children from <a

people, especially as they get older, don’t like moving outside of their intellectual comfort
zone, whereas I revel in taking on intellectual challenges in new fields outside of my comfort
zone. Note my "grand slams" in a wide range of application domains, where the only way to
quickly achieve expertise was self-learning admittedly with the help of highly qualified
mentors. I feel that I still maintain a high degree of child-like <a

this skill I retain by regular interaction with my own young grandchildren, where my play with
them is much more analytical than I used to exhibit with my own children.<a href="#fnref2"

<li id="fn3"><p><strong>York Univ:</strong> Exceptionally I passed my comprehensive examinations
before I took any of the required economics courses! Therefore the school allowed me to take any
accredited courses from any Canadian university. I had initially wanted to take a graduate
degree in engineering from the Univ of Toronto but they refused to accept me as a
<em>regular</em> student, but they allowed me to enroll as a <em>special</em> student. In fact
most of my courses for the York degree were from the Univ of Toronto graduate school of
engineering.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p><strong>Chosen People:</strong> It is quite telling that that the biggest haters
of the Jewish People throughout history derive their hatred from this exact verse. What
infuriates them is that Jews are the conscience of the world, who recognize a higher Divine law
than <em>patently immoral</em> laws of dictators and kings, and even of elected governments
(e.g. Pharaoh, Haman, and Hitler). On the other hand, it is important to remember that
throughout history there have existed a few brave non-Jews who <a
href="https://rabbisacks.org/covenant-conversation/shemot/on-not-obeying-immoral-orders/">feared
God</a> by defying patently immoral laws of their governments, e.g. the Egyptian midwives Shifra
and Puah in <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0201.htm">Exodus 1:17</a>, and modern day
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Righteous_Among_the_Nations">righteous gentiles</a> who
hid Jews from the Nazis at great risk to their own lives.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn5"><p><strong>IDF General Staff depravity:</strong> From the Oslo Accords to this day
(2025) it is accurate to describe the IDF General Staff as depraved. Generals who are promoted
to the General Staff are selected precisely because their main goal is <em>no longer</em> to
unequivocally win wars, or to save as many civilian lives as possible, or to save the lives of
their soldiers. We saw this clearly in their total lack of preparedness for the recent October 7
Hamas massacres. We saw it in their denial that the so-called <em>Disengagement</em> would be a
future existential disaster. We saw it in their lackluster execution of the Second Lebanese War.
They are selected because they internalize the pseudo ethics of their bizarre "purity of arms"
philosophy. Due to the IDF's generous early retirement benefits, they view the IDF just as a
stepping stone in their future career path whether in politics or business, so they refrain from
engaging in any politically incorrect activities that might even prevent them from so much as
taking a vacation with their wives for a London shopping spree, because a UK court might indict
them for "abusing the rights" of a poor Palestinian. Note that the spectacular initial response
of the civilian reservists to the October 7 massacres was very much in spite of the hysteria and
lack of preparedness of the General Staff. And also note the fundamental flaw of their military
ethics guru <em>Asa Kasher</em>, who is worshiped by both the IDF and legal system, is that he
claims that our Islamic enemies want to share <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (English: Land of Israel)
with us with equal rights for all. However it has finally (2025) become painfully obvious to the
majority of sentient Israeli Jews, including secular ones, that the goal of our Islamic enemies
is to annihilate the Jewish presence here, exactly like the Nazis wanted to do to European
Jewry. The enemy acts exactly like <a
href="https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3942715/jewish/Who-Were-Amalek-and-the-Amalekites.htm">Amalek</a>
did, and we must treat them accordingly.<a href="#fnref5" class="footnote-back"
role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn6"><p><strong>Goldstein Massacre:</strong> The politically correct Israeli narrative
is that Goldstein was a mass murderer. There were a large number of discrepancies in the
testimony that are too long to discuss here, and that <em>Justice Shamgar</em> admitted he
simply chose to ignore. Peres had a huge motive to expel the "settlers" in order to make good on
his promise to Arafat that he be given a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei">Judenrein</a> Palestinian state because the
treaty that the <em>Knesset</em> and the people accepted did not call for such expulsions. As my
article clearly shows, the Oslo implementation was based on massive government lies - the most
egregious being the government's hiding of Arafat's responsibility for years of terrorism that
resulted in thousands of deaths. The judicial system "rubber stamped" all government decisions
that tread on "settler's" rights where the most egregious were stripping them of their gun
permits, and ten years later the Gush Katif <em>Disengagement</em> expulsion, and they "rubber
stamped" administrative detention of anti-Oslo activists that "magically" stopped as soon as
Bibi was first elected PM in 1996. There is no longer any <em>prima facie</em> reason to believe
in the objectivity of the Oslo judiciary. Therefore, I rely on the leaker's statement that
Goldstein was framed.<a href="#fnref6" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn7"><p><strong>Martin Schlaff:</strong> Schlaff's final <em>Stassi</em> act was
enabling senior <em>Stassi</em> agents to rifle the East German treasury just before the
reunification of East and West Germany in 1990. Rabin's last official meeting a few hours before
his assassination in 1995 just happened to be with Schlaff at which time they discussed the
Schlaff-Peres casino proposal to which Rabin was vehemently opposed. Rabin's Chief of Staff Dubi
Weisglass just so happened to represent Schlaff's business interests in Israel. Might this have
been the true motive for Rabin's assassination? During the casino's first year of operation it
had revenue of over $50M per month.<a href="#fnref7" class="footnote-back"

<li id="fn8"><p><strong>"Legal" Blackmail:</strong> The so-called "legal" system under the
leadership of then Chief Justice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Barak">Aharon
Barak</a> played a key role in enabling the Oslo Accords and the subsequent so-called
"Disengagement". During his tenure Israel became a legal "reign of terror". Selective
prosecution was <em>de rigueur</em>. Barak revived enforcement of the nebulous laws of <a
href="https://www.jewishpress.com/news/israel/government-israel/dm-katz-revokes-settlers-administrative-detentions-after-reinstating-them/2025/01/17/">administrative
detention of Jews</a> which allowed the authorities to simply jail particularly "obnoxious"
individuals opposed to the government's leftist policies, just like British Mandatory
authorities used to suppress Jewish dissenters. The most egregious subversions of justice by the
Barak court were (1) blackmailing then PM Sharon to implement the Disengagement or else face
criminal charges for his election campaign financing violations, and (2) the sham prosecution of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avishai_Raviv">Avishai Raviv</a>, i.e. the
<em>Shabak</em> agent who could directly connect the assassination of then PM Rabin to <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmi_Gillon">Carmi Gilon</a>, the then head of the
<em>Shabak</em>. Even though the new PM Peres was forced, by across-the-board public opinion, to
fire the disgraced Gilon, Peres shamelessly immediately rewarded him by appointing him to head a
government corporation (<em>Avner Insurance</em>), next as CEO of the <em>Peres Center</em>, and
next as ambassador to Denmark.<a href="#fnref8" class="footnote-back"
