<h2 tabindex="0">1.0 Summary</h2>
<p>I am an experienced computer scientist and S/W architect. I have devised innovative solutions to many S/W problems for a wide range of fields, including <a href="#viaccess">cybersecurity</a>, <a href="#patents">cryptography</a>, <a href="#syntezza">bioinformatics</a>, computer languages, <a href="#sfpc">factory automation</a>, <a href="#vyyo">telecommunications</a>, <a href="#virtouch">blind vision</a>, <a href="#light-pen">accessibility</a>, <a href="#telequest">transportation vehicle route guidance</a>, and <a href="#elop">test automation</a>. I have worked at executive level for a number of organizations, large and small, and helped them realize improvements in their product performance, often putting them in the front rank in their field. I have acquired expert knowledge in a number of fields, often liasing with noted experts, and have been able to quickly apply this knowledge to improve the competitive position of the companies and their products. I have a keen interest in computer languages, both practical and theoretical. I have created a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages (DSL)</a> that were instrumental in greatly simplifying seemingly intractable problems.</p>
<p>For the past 13 years, I worked primarily in the field of cybersecurity with a specialty in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">S/W obfuscation</a>, i.e. anti-reverse engineering techniques. Most recently I was head of security for an Internet pay TV product where the client devices were Android and IOS. The security critical portion of the application was implemented in native code, i.e. C/C++, and not in Java or Objective-C that were used solely for the UI. We obfuscated the native code. During my 6 year tenure we had 40M subscribers, and no hacks in the field.</p>
<p>I am still very much a <q>hands-on</q> S/W engineer too. Typically I work on novel and complex problems, where I must first create a working proof-of-concept before I can produce a specification that is firmly grounded in reality.</p>
<p>I am a consummate tool maker, where my tools are algorithms. I have a strong background in business and economics. I communicate well both orally and in writing. I am a native English speaker.</p>
<p>Usually I am able to apply knowledge and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaknowledge">meta-knowledge</a> that I have acquired from other fields, and apply it to the new one - what educational psychologists refer to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_of_learning">transfer of learning</a>. A common technique that I use is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a> that allows me to write a formal specification of a problem. With a little ingenuity the DSL can be used to create a working command line application, and it usually forms the basis of an automated testing framework. I successfully used a DSL to describe a <a href="#sfpc">shop floor production control</a> system, along with a compiler that executed/implemented the shop floor. And I used a DSL to describe a <a href="#dspg">CPU architecture</a>, along with a compiler that automatically generated a simulator/debugger, assembler, and C compiler. A common programming technique that I use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> with templates that allows me to automatically generate code by creating intelligent macros regardless of the underlying target programming language.</p>
<p>I am an <a href="http://99u.com/articles/7269/picasso-kepler-and-the-benefits-of-being-an-expert-generalist">expert generalist</a>, and an <a href="http://autodidactpolymath.com/autodidact-polymath-definition/">autodidact polymath</a>, i.e. a self-learner in new fields who achieves expertise quickly - often with the help of a good mentor. Also I am a good mentor myself. <strong>I slavishly attend to my own <a href="#continuing-ed">continuing education</a>.</strong></p>
<p>My CV is long because (1) I have 35 years of experience, (2) I have shown how I am able to apply my expertise to many different application domains, and (3) I mention details of projects that I did over 30 years ago which are still highly relevant today. Even though technology is progressing exponentially, some of these older projects were conceptual building blocks that are still a critically important component of my professional <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gestalt">gestalt</a>. For example, the first serious S/W algorithm that I developed was at the age of 15 in a high school computer science course when I designed a perfect game of <a href="#univ-toronto">3D 4x4x4 tic-tac-toe</a> in Fortran on the defunct <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1130">IBM 1130</a> with 16KB RAM. And in 1983 I wrote a <a href="#elta">RTOS (real-time operating system) kernel</a> for the defunct 8080 CPU using an ICE (in circuit emulator). These were profoundly formative learning experiences in spite of the fact that the H/W platforms are ancient by today’s standards. Consequently I have a deep understanding of operating systems and real-time programming. Even though for the rest of my career I have <em>not</em> been subsequently involved in <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/hard-real-time-system-immediate-real-time-system">hard real-time</a> programming, I have a deep understanding of the concept, and regularly apply the principles to the <em>soft</em> real-time applications in which I have been regularly engaged during the rest of my career. I understand what it means to develop S/W for environments that have limited H/W resources. Core S/W knowledge is not a function of the latest CPU design or of the programming language <em>du jour</em>. Similarly I mention my <a href="#personal">military leadership</a> experience that I acquired in my young adulthood which was a core personality growth experience that permeated the rest of my life which is completely unrelated to the fact that current military H/W is more advanced than when I served in the army.</p>

<ol>
<li tabindex="0"><p>I was head of security for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">Over-The-Top (OTT)</a> Internet pay TV product for 6 years. I joined the project shortly after its inception. When I left there were 40M subscribers, with no successful subscriber hacks/penetrations in the field.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>I was responsible for end-to-end security policy and architecture, and inclusion and implementation of security related programming utilities.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>The supported client devices were Android and IOS phones and tablets.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayReady">PlayReady</a>. Later we supported Google <a href="http://www.widevine.com/">Widevine</a>, and the <a href="http://www.viaccess-orca.com/content-protection.html">Viaccess-Orca</a> proprietary DRM.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>In a nutshell, my primary job was to protect the content, content decryption keys, and subscriber keys, on the client devices. The security critical modules were written in native code, i.e. C/C++, and <em>not</em> Java or Objective-C which were used solely for the UI. Obfuscation was designed to protect the native code from reverse engineering. I made it nearly impossible for an attacker to engage in <em>static</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a>, and made it extremely difficult to use the state-of-the-art <em>dynamic</em> reverse engineering tools such as the <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/">IDA Hex-Rays</a> decompiler/debugger.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>We supplied a reference application to our customers who were our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_access">CA</a> broadcaster/operator customers who needed to provide an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">OTT</a> option to their subscribers. They customized our reference application to their needs. We did not have a direct relationship with the subscribers. Our operators typically took a very long time to do their integration and QA before they would release/push their application to their subscribers. The fundamental technical flaw with this business model was that when we found a serious bug or a security problem in a core module, the operators would typically delay for 6-12 months before pushing the update to their subscribers.

<li tabindex="0">I designed algorithms and a computational infrastructure similar to what <a href="https://www.waze.com/">Waze</a> does today.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I implemented these algorithms on Tokyo traffic simulations which is the most traffic congested city in the Western world, and who happen to have a superb traffic data collection system.</li>

<li tabindex="0">The simulation S/W was written in Java. Due to the huge size of the simulations, I needed to optimize the Java code - in particular to control garbage collection.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The results of the Tokyo simulations were that with a threshold of just 20% guided vehicles on the roads, we could achieve up to a 50% performance decrease in travel times for guided vehicles, with a side effect of 40% decrease for non-guided vehicles. These results were the exact opposite of the competition which generated their own secondary traffic jams once the guided vehicle threshold reached 20% due to their simplistic opportunistic algorithms.

<p><em><span class="citation" data-cites="Syntezza">@Syntezza</span>, Jerusalem:</em></p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">Within 3 months of joining the company and quickly learning the basics of bioinformatics, I discovered a new algorithm using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science techniques for handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a> - which I am in the process of <a href="#patents">patenting</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The client’s product was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus">MRSA</a> (= a lethal staphylococcus bacteria that is antibiotic resistant and thrives in hospitals) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (= DNA amplification/duplication technology) detection kit. Typically the kit would be used in hospitals to determine whether a newly admitted patient was a MRSA carrier. A PCR test can return results within 2 hours, whereas the <q>gold standard</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Petri dish</a> test, which was developed over 100 years ago, takes at least 36 hours. Given that MRSA is infectious, and potentially fatal, it is important for hospitals to be aware ASAP which patients are carriers.</li>
<li tabindex="0">When I started the project, the client’s PCR kit had only a 50% detection rate due to inhibition problems. This result was grossly unacceptable for any medical test. The investors had lost confidence, and were about to pull out.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I improved the test’s accuracy to 95%, which was 10% better than their competitors from the pharmaceutical giants. I saved the client from liquidation.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I stood on the shoulders of the person who developed the original <a href="http://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/qpcr-education/pcr-understanding-ct-application-note.html">PCR Ct</a> function analytical detection algorithm, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=XokRoVQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Tzachi Bar</a>, who was my mentor, and who got me up to speed so quickly.</li>

<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I worked on a wide variety of security related projects. My background task was to do code security reviews. Typically secure coding is achieved by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL5o4PFuxTY">adhering to best programming practices</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was a member of the architecture team for their in-house <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscating</a> compiler.</li>

<li tabindex="0">I worked with the operational security team to track hackers, and to provide stealth techniques for our researchers.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I arranged for world class security researchers to give seminars, (1) a week long reverse engineering seminar, and (2) a 2 day seminar how to hack with virtual machines.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote the technical bid for securing the 2008 Olympics Beijing Olympics TV broadcasts.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I researched business cases for providing security services to the computer gaming industry, and for printer ink cartridges. For example sales revenue from premier games can gross $60M in their first 2 weeks, by which time they are typically hacked. Improving security so that the hack can be delayed for another 2 weeks, can increase revenue by 50%.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I advised senior management on the technical and business merits of potential acquisitions.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I did a very interesting and important non-security related project for senior management, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a> the company’s bug database, that showed that 25% of S/W development manpower was wasted on fixing bugs. And I showed them simple techniques that could reduce this number by 80% .</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a hybrid simulator/emulator debugger for legacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box">Set-Top Boxes (STB)</a> that originally could be debugged only with <code>printf</code> statements to log files. My new debugger allowed source code on the PC to be debugged using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio">MS Visual Studio IDE</a> debugger while still viewing the results on the STB. Implementation was accomplished by reverse engineering the STB middleware API. 80% of the middleware ran natively on the PC, while the STB low level H/W specific portions were implemented via an agent on the STB that was accessed via API calls that were implemented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote an automated testing system for a satellite content delivery system for huge content, e.g. delivering ultra high definition movies to cinemas, and print newspapers for remote publishing. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language (DSL)</a> in order to execute the satellite operations. After studying the Win32 source code of the satellite ground control station, I detected a major conceptual flaw which the architect refused to believe (because testers are not supposed to understand Win32 internals!). So I wrote a progressive test that brought the satellite to its knees at only 25% of its rated capacity. Afterwards the development team used my tool to develop their own unit test scripts, and to execute a system sanity test before checking-in any changes to the source control system.</li>

<p><em><span class="citation" data-cites="Virtouch">@Virtouch</span>, Jerusalem:</em></p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">My task was to change the company’s focus from providing tools for teaching blind children Braille skills to instead provide tools for blind adults to use at work.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">The fact of the matter is that government social services agencies around the world are much more concerned about funding tools that allow the blind to integrate into the work force, and thus become economically self sufficient, versus funding educational tools for blind children.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">Previously the company had developed a <a href="http://www.avrahambernstein.com/resources/vtplayer.png">tactile mouse</a> that was far too expensive for our target audience (~$350).</li>
<li tabindex="0">I abandoned the mouse because (a) it was too expensive, and (b) the blind find it very difficult to use mice because mouse movement must be coordinated with the cursor on the screen which they cannot see.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed new algorithms that allowed the blind to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> maps using SVG and XML combined with audio cues (by using pitch and volume), and by using an off-the-shelf graphics tablets and stylus (that were much less expensive than our tactile mouse).</li>
<li tabindex="0">The blind prefer graphic tablets because they inherently have accurate spatial knowledge of their position on the tablet because they can feel it.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The S/W needs to make a rectilinear mapping of the tablet into a desktop window.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The same techniques could be used for displaying mathematical functions and geometry.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I <em>almost</em> saved the company from liquidation. My research was awarded a European FP6 grant of $0.5M Euro that required <em>matching funds</em>. But the investors refused to put up the matching funds due to the company’s long history of financial failure in the children’s market.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The most important business lesson that I learned was that building special purpose H/W for the disabled is a recipe for bankruptcy; but if you can repurpose off-the-shelf H/W, typically designed for gamers, then you can financially succeed in the accessibility/disability market.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The most important personal lesson that I learned was how satisfying it was working with the blind volunteers, and supplying them with a tool that allowed them to <q>see</q>.</li>

<li tabindex="0">Iskar Matkash in Tefen IL is a fully automated factory that produces thousands of different cutting blades using a sintering process. The raw materials go through many stages of operations. In many cases after undergoing intermediate processing, the partially processed material can still be diverted to multiple final products - similar to stem cells. The factory contains hundreds of automated workstations, stands, stacks, guided vehicles, and conveyor belts. The product or intermediate product is placed on pallets. The pallets are moved from one stand on a workstation to a stand on another workstation, or temporarily to a storage stand or stack.</li>
<li tabindex="0">My task was to create a computer program that automatically operated/orchestrated the factory.</li>
<li tabindex="0">When my co-architect and I started this project, we had zero background in industrial engineering. We were supplied with a mentor who brought us up to speed.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Eventually after months of discussions we created an architecture that was a textbook object oriented taxonomy - a <q>factory object kingdom</q>. The top level object was a <q>production instruction</q>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">We defined the attributes and methods associated with each object.</li>
<li tabindex="0">We created a descriptive, i.e. <em>non-procedural</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a> that was designed to be user-friendly for the factory engineer.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote the language manual.</li>
<li tabindex="0">We used the language to configure the factory. We created a UI wrapper for the language which emitted CLI script.</li>
<li tabindex="0">We mapped the language to a relational database.</li>

<li tabindex="0">First of all, it important to note that this project took place in 1988 when speech-to-text technology was still in its infancy, and exhorbitantly expensive.</li>

<li tabindex="0">The light pen was mounted on the user’s head by using a sturdy woman’s plastic hair head band, while the sip-and-puff straw replaced the button on the light pen.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The S/W that I developed overlaid a virtual keyboard on top of the screen.</li>
<li tabindex="0">In novice mode aiming the pen at a key caused it to illuminate, while clicking on it entered it into the system as a virtual key stroke.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The problem with novice mode was that the virtual keyboard obstructed more than half the screen.</li>
<li tabindex="0">In expert mode, the virtual keyboard was hidden, but when the pen was aimed at an individual key, it would pop-up and become illuminated.</li>
<li tabindex="0">This system was used to enable Shulamit Gabbai, a former school teacher who became quadriplegic by contacting polio (due to a terrible malfunction in the <em>Or Akiva</em> drinking water supply which became mixed with sewage), to become a book editor for <em>Maariv</em>.

<h2 tabindex="0">8.0 Personal</h2>
<p>I was born in Canada in 1956. I have lived in Jerusalem Israel since 1983. I am married with 4 children, 2B + 2G, plus many grandchildren. I take physical fitness seriously. Once upon a time I was a judoka, and a classical guitarist. I was an IDF reserve soldier for 15 years, where I served as a combat soldier in the infantry in the Jordan Valley. In spite of the fact that I joined the army when I was 32 years old (Hebrew: <em>Shlav Betnik</em>), functionally, but unofficially, I served in the capacity of deputy company commander (Hebrew: <em>Samech Mem Pe</em>) which provided me with the opportunity to achieve rich personal growth, and enabled me to learn important managerial and leadership skills.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>This secure photo was built using an <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-oilify.html">oilify</a> filter and a visible email address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking">watermark</a>. It uses <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5510040/designer-reverse-engineers-face-detection-tech-to-develop-camouflage-makeup">digital camouflage</a> that will defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1) Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication (2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying my photo while attempting to associate/label it with any other name besides mine. Similarly if a site were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association or agreement with them, then it is trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to <q>challenge</q> the site by asking me for a verification email.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
