<h2 tabindex="0">1.0 Summary</h2>
<p>I am a computer scientist and technologist. I work at the CTO level. I am innovative and creative. I have a strong background in economics. I communicate well both orally and in writing.</p>
<p>I am a master S/W engineer and architect of industrial strength systems. I am <q>hands-on</q>. Typically due to the complex and novel nature of the problems that I solve, first I need to build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept">proofs of concept (POC)</a> before completing architectural and design specifications. After 35 years I still feel it is the most creative profession that I could have chosen.</p>
<p>For the past 13 years, I worked primarily in the field of cybersecurity with a specialty in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">S/W obfuscation</a>, i.e. anti-reverse engineering techniques. I have also worked in a broad range of other application domains where I have quickly come up to speed, and functioned at an expert level. These domains include <a href="#consultant-bioinformatics-pcr-algorithms">bioinformatics</a>, <a href="#patents-under-development">cryptography</a>, <a href="#vp-rd-urban-traffic-vehicle-route-guidance">transportation</a>, <a href="#cto-blind-accessibility-hw-sw-to-enable-viewing-of-digital-images-maps">blind vision</a>, <a href="#sw-architect-implementation-quadriplegic-pc-accessibility">accessibility</a>, <a href="#ceo-cto-sw-architect-implementation-of-sw-toolchain-for-dspg-pine-cpu">VLSI CPU design</a>, and <a href="#sw-architect-implementation-shop-floor-production-control-sfpc-system-bari-ii">factory automation</a>. For example just a few years ago, after only a few months in the new (for me) field of bioinformatics, I developed a new <a href="http://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/qpcr-education/pcr-understanding-ct-application-note.html">PCR Ct</a> calculation algorithm which overcomes the problem of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a>. I am in the process of patenting this algorithm. I was fortunate that my mentor was the one who developed the original algorithm - which is the one most cited in this field in Google Scholar.</p>
<p>Invariably I am able to apply knowledge and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaknowledge">meta-knowledge</a> that I have acquired from other fields, and apply it to the new one. A common technique that I use is to create a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a> that allows me to write a formal specification of a problem. With a little ingenuity the DSL can be used to create a working command line application, and it usually forms the basis of an automated testing framework. I successfully used a DSL to describe a <a href="#sw-architect-implementation-shop-floor-production-control-sfpc-system-bari-ii">shop floor production control system</a>, along with a compiler that executed/implemented the shop floor. And I used a DSL to describe a <a href="#ceo-cto-sw-architect-implementation-of-sw-toolchain-for-dspg-pine-cpu">CPU architecture</a>, along with a compiler that automatically generated a simulator/debugger, assembler, and C compiler. A common programming technique that I use is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogramming</a> with templates that allows me to automatically generate code by creating intelligent macros regardless of the underlying target programming language.</p>
<p>I am an <a href="http://99u.com/articles/7269/picasso-kepler-and-the-benefits-of-being-an-expert-generalist">expert generalist</a>, and an <a href="http://autodidactpolymath.com/autodidact-polymath-definition/">autodidact polymath</a>, i.e. a self-learner in new fields who achieves expertise quickly. I know how to find and utilize mentors who are experts in the new field. I am also a good mentor myself. I slavishly attend to my <a href="#continuing-education">continuing education</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I was head of security for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">Over-The-Top (OTT)</a> Internet pay TV product for 6 years. I joined the project shortly after its inception. When I left there were 40M subscribers, and there were no successful hacks in the field.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">The company fired me because they were in financial shock due to the sharp drop in their primary source of revenue from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card">smart card</a> sales for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_access">Conditional Access (CA)</a> product which are being annihilated by the pure OTT operators such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">I was responsible for end-to-end security policy and architecture, and inclusion and implementation of security related programming utilities.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">We used the <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile">Jira</a> system for agile project management.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>The supported client devices were Android and IOS phones and tablets. The subscriber ID was based upon the built-in Android device ID, and the built-in IOS device-application ID, respectively.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>We supplied a reference application to our customers who were our <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_access">CA</a> broadcaster/operator customers who needed to provide an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">OTT</a> option to their subscribers. They customized our reference application to their needs. We did not have a direct relationship with the subscribers. Our operators typically took a very long time to do their integration and QA before they would release/push their application to their subscribers. The fundamental technical flaw with this business model was that when we found a serious bug or a security problem in the core modules, the operators would typically delay for 6-12 months before pushing the update to their subscribers. Eventually I architected a solution that provided good enough security (see <a href="#new-config">below</a>), while still satisfying the QA needs of our customers.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayReady">PlayReady</a>. Later we supported Google <a href="http://www.widevine.com/">Widevine</a>, and the <a href="http://www.viaccess-orca.com/content-protection.html">Viaccess-Orca</a> proprietary DRM.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>For security reasons, all client S/W was implemented in native machine code, i.e. in C/C++, except for the UI which was implemented in Java and Objective-C, for Android and IOS respectively.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0">Some S/W security tools we purchased, namely the <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-security/">InterTrust/WhiteCryption</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscating</a> compiler and white-box encryption tools.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0"><p><em>Prima facie</em> these tools seemed very expensive. The combined package costs $100+K, plus the standard 15% annual maintenance fee. However having been involved in the development of similar tools at Cisco-NDS (see below), they are very complex and can easily consume 5-10 man-years of development. Therefore buying them off-the-shelf made economic sense. When we first purchased the obfuscating compiler, the product was new, and had bugs. On account of my background having built a similar tool myself, I worked closely with the vendor’s architect to help debug their product, and suggested and specified feature improvements.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>The primary technique used in state-of-the-art <em>binary</em> obfuscation is to randomly change program flow by using opaque conditions and jumps that fool the compiler that seem to grossly change the flow, even though the final result of program execution is the same. Note that it is the job of our application build process to compile and link in a way that minimizes the use of global symbols.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>White-box encryption relies upon wrapped keys and mathematical transformations that make it very difficult to recognize that a well known cryptographic algorithm is being executed, e.g. AES or SHA-1.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">Many S/W security tools I architected and implemented in-house:
<ol type="a">
<li tabindex="0"><p>Designed a sophisticated Android root detection mechanism.</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">Obvious signs of a rooted Android device can be determined easily from the the device’s <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/build/index.html">build properties</a>. But other rooting techniques are not as clear, so I developed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> scoring algorithm. Based upon subscriber feedback, my rate of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a> was extremely low.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Unfortunately near the end of my tenure, the big studios, e.g. Disney and Sony, relented on their former requirement to refuse to play on rooted devices due to significant loss of royalties from inexpensive off-the-shelf rooted devices from the Far East that represented over 25% of subscriber devices. Therefore the root detection mechanism had to become much more sophisticated. Either I had to detect the existence of a hacker configured device, or alternatively I had to recognize dynamic behavior that an actual attack was underway, e.g. memory tampering, the device was streaming, a debugger process was running, or the device was attached to the Android <code>adb</code> utility. However all Android developers and field engineers must use <code>adb</code>. Therefore I created a temporary (i.e. maximum 72 hour) device ID specific <code>adb</code> exception mechanism in the cloud for authorized devices. Since the vast majority of attackers use <code>adb</code> in order to launch, or at least to prepare, an attack, this anti-<code>adb</code> mechanism is one of the most important security features.</li>
<li tabindex="0">A major security hole has been created by the new Chrome O/S feature that uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">Virtual Machine (VM)</a> to execute Android 7.0+ apps. We can continue to detect and to block other VM environments, but from a marketing perspective once the popularity of Chrome O/S reaches a significant threshold, it may no longer be possible to block it.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Because the root detection mechanism has been diluted, it became necessary to add security functionality to the server side. For example it is easy to detect that a subscriber who is in the 95th percentile of monthly content viewing hours, or one who views content simultaneously from multiple IP addresses, or whose IP address is volatile from geographically disparate regions.

<li tabindex="0"><p>Designed a dynamic mechanism for testing code integrity and read-only data integrity.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Designed a light weight <em>distributed</em> encryption library for situations where performance consideration precluded use of AES. In order to preclude a single point of attack, the library was small enough to allow every module that needed it to have its own private and customized copy. This library was implemented as an <code>.h</code> file collection of <code>static</code> and <code>inline</code> functions and variables. Every instance had its own unique static and dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector">initialization vector (IV)</a>, and every instance had its own unique masks for the cryptographic constants that it used. (This uniqueness was ensured by using precompiled preprocessor random number tables that were designed to be different according to the preprocessor module ID selector of including C/C++ module). Otherwise if the constants were not masked, then simply looking up the constants on the Internet would easily reveal the algorithms. The masking technique had to be extremely efficient, but it also had to outsmart the optimizing compiler’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding">constant folding</a> feature.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Architected a secure and efficient data collection and anomaly logging utility, where the data was sent to the web servers for off-line analysis.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Designed a mechanism for light weight randomized encryption of function arguments to foil stack probing so that no two sets of encrypted function parameters were ever the same even when the in-the-clear parameters were in fact identical. Implementation was via a light weight <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> algorithm that I invented.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Designed a light weight randomized obfuscation of all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a> calls - in order to blind dynamic reverse engineering tools which use the libc calls as an anchor.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Architected, but did not implement, a replacement of the built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library">libc</a> calls with an obfuscated version of <a href="https://www.musl-libc.org/">musl</a>.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Architected, but did not implement, an efficient secure logging/debug utility. We did not want to allow our foreign commercial agents to have access to the in-the-clear log messages. And without dynamic configuration/filtering of the log messages, the massive debug communication traffic would cause playback <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jitter">jitter</a>.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p><a id="new-config"/>Architected, but did not implement, a secure static and dynamic configuration mechanism including a cryptographic key ladder mechanism. Now only the single operator specific master key had to be <q>baked in</q>, by using obfuscation, into the release of the operator specific <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">DSO</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">This configuration file was a replacement for the original awkward mechanism that baked all keys into the operator specific DSO. Since the operators resisted frequent updates of their DSOs, we were not able to make agile and frequent key changes on the servers.</li>
<li tabindex="0">This mechanism would also allow us to make agile changes to the Android security database, e.g. to the list of packages commonly found on hacker devices, and to the list of device drivers used for O/S builds designed to run on virtual machines.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Generally our customers, i.e. the operators, were far less resistant to pushing relatively frequent database changes to their subscribers - as opposed to code updates. But it required that we modify our application architecture to make it data driven wherever possible.
<p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li tabindex="0">In a nutshell, my primary job was to protect the content, content decryption keys, and subscriber keys, on the client devices. I made it nearly impossible for an attacker to engage in <em>static</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a>, and made it extremely difficult to use the state-of-the-art <em>dynamic</em> reverse engineering tools such as the <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/">IDA Hex-Rays</a> decompiler/debugger.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Due to the challenging and novel nature of the features that I architected, I usually built a working proof-of-concept (POC) before handing the final specification to the programmers. Typically my implementation was language was C, as opposed to C++, because the project was comprised of both C and C++ modules, so using a C interface was the lowest common denominator.</p></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Due to the large number of preprocessing and postprocessing utilities in our build process, I had to do my own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps">devops</a> <q>plumbing</q> changes in order to do end-to-end testing of my POCs.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0"><p>Unfortunately the bottom line with respect to security is that no matter how well protected the client S/W is, you have to expect that it will eventually be hacked. Without pushing a new randomly obfuscated version, say every 60-90 days, no protection scheme will work.</p></li>

<h3 tabindex="0">2010-10: Consultant: Transparent Technical Negotiator of Restricted Hi-Tech Trade with China</h3>
<p><em><span class="citation" data-cites="Anonymous">@Anonymous</span>:</em></p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy a restricted gyroscope for their super high speed trains from Honeywell that is normally used for ICBMs. I proposed to Honeywell that they insert the gyroscope into the center of a tamper proof lead block that weighed say 50-100 kg. For example if the soft membrane surrounding the gyroscope were penetrated with a blade or drill or laser then it would release acid or a binary explosive. Honeywell would be responsible for developing the tamper proof mechanism. They did not have to reveal to the Chinese how they built the mechanism. All they had to do was to give the Chinese a fixed price quote for the custom work. Clearly such a device could not be used on a missile where every extra gram of weight counts, but where the extra weight was of no consequence to the train. Honeywell agreed.<br />
</li>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy the restricted Green Hills real-time operating system. The US government restricts the export of Green Hills source code, but not products that contain Green Hills’ binaries. So I asked Green Hills if I could have the board support package (BSP) developed in Israel which requires access to Green Hills source code, but ship the resulting binaries to China. Green Hills agreed.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy a drone system from a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) which was designed for commercial/industrial use. The system had cruise missile like navigation capabilities with the ability to do terrain contour matching. Since the device inherently required GPS navigational capability, I suggested to IAI that they modify their software so that it would not work within 500 km of the Israeli border, along with a back-door jamming channel - due to the fact that it is not uncommon for the Chinese to resell this type of equipment to the Iranians who regularly announce their religious obligation to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.</li>
<li tabindex="0">An Israeli company which develops expensive VLSI design software, e.g. $50-100K per workstation, was afraid that their Chinese agent would cheat them of their royalties. The initial deal was to sell an older version of the software for a one-time flat fee of 20 licenses, in order that the Chinese dealer would be allowed to sell an unlimited number of the older licenses. But I specified how they should re-architect the next version of their software to be converted to Software As A Service (SaaS) on cloud servers. Each licensed subscriber has a workspace on the cloud where the heavy lifting and <q>secret sauce</q> are executed, while the client workstations only act as the UI. It provides excellent security against license theft.

<h3 tabindex="0">2009-09: Consultant: Bioinformatics PCR Algorithms</h3>
<p><em><span class="citation" data-cites="Syntezza">@Syntezza</span>, Jerusalem:</em></p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">Within 3 months of joining the company and quickly learning the basics of bioinformatics, I discovered a new algorithm using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science techniques for handling <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors">PCR inhibition</a> - which I am in the process of <a href="#patents-under-development">patenting</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The client’s product was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus">MRSA</a> (= a lethal staphylococcus bacteria that is antibiotic resistant and thrives in hospitals) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction">PCR</a> (= DNA amplification/duplication technology) detection kit. Typically the kit would be used in hospitals to determine whether a newly admitted patient was a MRSA carrier. A PCR test can return results within 2 hours, whereas the <q>gold standard</q> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_dish">Petri dish</a> test, which was developed over 100 years ago, takes at least 36 hours. Given that MRSA is infectious, and potentially fatal, it is important for hospitals to be aware ASAP which patients are carriers.</li>
<li tabindex="0">When I started the project, the client’s PCR kit had only a 50% detection rate due to inhibition problems. This result was grossly unacceptable for any medical test. The investors had lost confidence, and were about to pull out.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I improved the test’s accuracy to 95%, which was 10% better than their competitors from the pharmaceutical giants. I saved the client from liquidation.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I stood on the shoulders of the person who developed the original <a href="http://www.thermofisher.com/il/en/home/life-science/pcr/real-time-pcr/qpcr-education/pcr-understanding-ct-application-note.html">PCR Ct</a> function analytical detection algorithm, <a href="https://scholar.google.co.il/citations?user=XokRoVQAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Dr. Tzachi Bar</a>, who was my mentor, and who got me up to speed so quickly.</li>
</ol>
<section id="methodology" class="level4">
<h4 tabindex="0">Methodology</h4>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I had access to a database of about 800 MRSA patient nasal sample PCR test results, along with about 20 samples from pure laboratory MRSA colonies that contained a known quantity of the bacteria. All the patient samples had also been analyzed via the <q>gold standard</q> Petri dish test. The Petri dish results were required to calibrate the PCR algorithm/results, and would be the basis of government health services (e.g. FDA) subsequent approval of the kit. As is typical in random patient samples, less than 10% were MRSA positive.</li>
<li tabindex="0">First of all, I noted an outrageous data anomaly, namely that the original kit failed to detect as positive many of the samples from the laboratory colonies. After investigating further, and reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_cycler">PCR thermocycler</a> manual, I realized that the position of the negative and positive control sample test tubes had been systematically placed in the wrong test tube slot positions - according to the original incorrect experimental protocol. Note that as is typical in these kinds of tests, every batch must contain both a positive and negative control. (For this particular device, there can be a maximum of 36 test tubes in a batch). The PCR algorithm uses these controls for calibrating itself. Given that we were fortunate to the have raw results from the thermocycler, I was able to reconstruct the results by using the correct positive and negative controls.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Even though as a result of recalibration, the results significantly improved, still they were poor. Further investigation showed that only the samples whose graphs resembled the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic function</a> (= a flat <q>S</q> shaped curve) expected for the standard mathematical analysis of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioassay">biological assays</a>, had results that were consistent with the Petri dish results.</li>
<li tabindex="0">More than 50% of the graphs of the patient samples did not exhibit the flat <q>S</q> shape curve due to PCR inhibition resulting from the use of ineffective preliminary chemistry during sample preparation, and therefore could not be analyzed by the industry standard mathematical techniques used to estimate the Ct.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I used patented techniques (which I cannot yet describe) <em>that did not calculate the Ct</em> to overcome the above 2 problems.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I split the samples into 2 random groups of equal size. I made sure that the 2 groups contained the same number of positive, negative, and laboratory colony samples.</li>
<li tabindex="0">One group was used for training, while the second group was used to test the predictive capability of the model.</li>
<li tabindex="0">As I stated above, the predicative accuracy of the new algorithm was over 95%.</li>

<li tabindex="0">I worked with the operational security team to track hackers, and to provide stealth techniques for our researchers.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I arranged for world class security researchers to give seminars, (1) a week long reverse engineering seminar, and (2) a 2 day seminar how to hack with virtual machines.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote the technical bid for securing the 2008 Olympics Beijing Olympics TV broadcasts.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I researched business cases for providing security services to the computer gaming industry, and for printer ink cartridges.

<li tabindex="0">I advised senior management on the technical and business merits of potential acquisitions.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I did a very interesting and important non-security related project for senior management, by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining">data mining</a> the company’s bug database, that showed that 25% of S/W development manpower was wasted on fixing bugs. And I showed them simple techniques that could reduce this number by 80% .</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a hybrid simulator/emulator debugger for legacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box">Set-Top Boxes (STB)</a> that originally could be debugged only with <code>printf</code> statements to log files. My new debugger allowed source code on the PC to be debugged using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio">MS Visual Studio IDE</a> debugger while still viewing the results on the STB. Implementation was accomplished by reverse engineering the STB middleware API. 80% of the middleware ran natively on the PC, while the STB low level H/W specific portions were implemented via an agent on the STB that was accessed via API calls that were implemented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote an automated testing system for a satellite content delivery system for huge content, e.g. delivering ultra high definition movies to cinemas, and print newspapers for remote publishing. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language (DSL)</a> in order to execute the satellite operations. After studying the Win32 source code of the satellite ground control station, I detected a major conceptual flaw which the architect refused to believe (because testers are not supposed to understand Win32 internals!). So I wrote a progressive test that brought the satellite to its knees at only 25% of its rated capacity. Afterwards the development team used my tool to develop their own unit test scripts, and to execute a system sanity test before checking-in any changes to the source control system.</li>

<li tabindex="0">My task was to change the company’s focus from providing tools for teaching blind children Braille skills to instead provide tools for blind adults to use at work.

<li tabindex="0">The fact of the matter is that government social services agencies around the world are much more concerned about funding tools that allow the blind to integrate into the work force, and thus become economically self sufficient, versus funding educational tools for blind children.<br />

<li tabindex="0">I designed a hybrid IP connection for cable modems where there was no physical cable upstream channel. Instead the upstream channel used a telephone modem (ATA), while the downstream channel used the cable modem. Head end network equipment for both interfaces was supplied by the cable operator. My solution was to dynamically modify the arp table of the edge router. For typical surfing, the effective downstream rate was as fast as a pure cable solution. The company applied for a patent.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I greatly improved the efficiency of the laboratory modem speed stress testing by a factor of 10-100 by using a <q>steepest descent</q> search algorithm instead of a binary search algorithm. Reduced testing time per modem from hours to minutes.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a virtual testing lab with 64K modems and 512K PCs via multiplexing the physical connections. The test lab had only 256 physical cable modems, 4 physical PCs with 8 network connections each, 1 cable router, and 2 24-port layer-2 programmable switches. By dynamically editing the PC MAC addresses, and by dynamically editing the MAC filters on the network switches, I was able to stress test the router into believing that it faced 64K modems, and the modems into believing that each one was shared by 16 PCs.</li>

<li tabindex="0">This was a very challenging <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> port because the architecture had no registers, or alternatively an infinite number of registers, while RAM access was highly unusual in order to accommodate the 128 cores.</li>

<li tabindex="0">The machine instruction set was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>-like, so it presented some unusual optimization challenges, because it was so unlike the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a> instruction sets.</li>

<li tabindex="0">The company product was the weapon fire control system for the Night Hawk laser guided missiles.</li>
<li tabindex="0">My task was to create an architecture and implementation of the automated test procedures dictated by the US DOD. The test specification documentation was over 1 meter high.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Additionally there would be many <em>ad hoc</em> tests that would be required during the development process.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The test equipment included external voltage regulators, external heating and cooling equipment, vibrators, etc.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The workstation controlling the tests was a Windows NT PC.</li>

<li tabindex="0">I made this critical architectural decision because the test specification manual was being regularly revised, plus I needed the flexibility to allow the system engineers to write their own scripts without delving into the underlying C code.

<li tabindex="0">Iskar Matkash in Tefen IL is a fully automated factory that produces thousands of different cutting blades using a sintering process. The raw materials go through many stages of operations. In many cases after undergoing intermediate processing, the partially processed material can still be diverted to multiple final products - similar to stem cells. The factory contains hundreds of automated workstations, stands, stacks, guided vehicles, and conveyor belts. The product or intermediate product is placed on pallets. The pallets are moved from one stand on a workstation to a stand on another workstation, or temporarily to a storage stand or stack.</li>

<h3 tabindex="0">6.1 Programming Languages Musings</h3>
<p>It may not be politically correct to say this, but C++ is too <a href="https://medium.com/@cscalfani/goodbye-object-oriented-programming-a59cda4c0e53">dangerous</a> to use for the average project. <em>Even though during the the architecture phase of a project, it is critically important to identify common classes and objects, interfaces, and frameworks, I find that C++ object oriented implementations are highly error prone, and are sinkholes for R&amp;D manpower resources.</em> Inexperienced architects and programmers create class hierarchies that are extremely brittle. In performance sensitive and embedded real-time projects most programmers do not understand the C++ language internals sufficiently in order to realize which language features cannot be used in such an environment. Therefore I prefer to write C code with an object oriented <q>flavor</q>. In my professional opinion, it is much safer to develop using the simpler, but tried and true, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition">composition</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming)">interface</a> programming techniques combined with C’s built-in, but underused, generic programming syntax - see <a href="http://www.robertgamble.net/2012/01/c11-generic-selections.html">C11 generics</a> and the gcc/clang <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Typeof.html">__typeof__ and __auto_type</a> operators. My reservations about C++ are shared by such well known people as <a href="https://developers.slashdot.org/story/15/03/10/2038228/was-linus-torvalds-right-about-c-being-so-wrong">Linus Torvalds</a>, and <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq">Rob Pike and Ken Thompson</a>. Admittedly C has many dangers too, but I feel much less than C++, perhaps because I have 30 years experience programming with it. The biggest problem that inexperienced C programmers face is memory leaks; however using <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> combined with well designed unit testing and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzzing</a> can catch almost all memory problems.</p>
<p>In spite of my reservations about C++, I am pragmatic. There are some application domains where it is clearly the best choice of implementation language. For example in the case of compiler design, C++ is the best way to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">ASTs</a>.</p>
<p>Google created their new <a href="https://golang.org">Go language</a> precisely for the above reasons. It is their <q>go-to</q> language for new projects. For the vast majority of their applications, they would never even consider C/C++, because the average programmer does not have the high level of expertise required to produce large apps built with C/C++ that are bug-free. First they were a Java shop which they dropped due to its never-ending security bugs, and due to the fact that they could not control the language due to a never-ending intellectual property battle with Oracle who <q>owns</q> Java. Then they switched to free open source Python, including hiring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>, Python’s <q>benevolent dictator for life</q>. But they became dissatisfied with Python due to its lack of type safety, problematic package management, and its poor performance. Go is a vastly improved and safer version of C, along with an extremely well designed package manager. Go’s performance is 2-4 times slower than C. It is in the same performance category as Java and C#, while Go is about 2-4 times faster than Python. Typically Go’s performance problems arise due to its automatic garbage collector (GC) - which is a key feature expected in most modern languages. But in most cases an experienced C/C++ programmer who inherently understands how to efficiently control memory allocations can <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/recycling-memory-buffers-in-go/">tune Go’s GC</a>. Go’s performance is good enough for the most demanding web server and back-end applications, although in general the GC precludes it from being used for soft real-time applications. Go is good for client applications too. There is excellent support for many UIs. It does not yet have full mobile support, but it is on their road map. Precisely because Go is the Google’s own internal application language, the language will continue to improve. Up until now Go has made a few architectural decisions with which I disagree, namely lack of generics, asserts, and a preprocessor. On the other hand, many other languages have similar problems or worse. I can easily correct these deficiencies by using my own macro/template preprocessor - where my tool of choice is <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a>. But I am aware that many programmers cannot tolerate preprocessing their source code, unless the preprocessor is connected <q>at the hip</q> to the compiler.</p>
<p>For new projects that need to <q>press the pedal to the metal</q>, the new safe and efficient system programming languages <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)">Rust</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim_(programming_language)">Nim</a> should be considered. My personal preference is for Nim especially on account of its superb built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming">metaprogamming</a> capability. But Nim is currently supported by only a small team mostly of volunteers, while Rust has much more market traction because it is backed by the Mozilla organization.</p>
<p>Again pragmatism prevails, in spite of my theoretical language preference for Go over Python, or dabbling with Nim and Rust, because there are many application domains where Python has superb 3rd party libraries that would reduce the development time of a proof of concept by at least a factor of 3 (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy">NumPy</a>, <a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, <a href="http://opensourceforu.com/2017/03/python-libraries-data-visualisation/">data visualization</a>, etc.), so choosing to use Python is very often the most productive decision by far.</p>
<p>Finally, I find for creating specifications for novel and complex ideas, I like to start by brainstorming with <a href="https://lifehacker.com/five-best-mind-mapping-tools-476534555">mind maps</a> and then move to <a href="https://wiki.tcl.tk/15542">TCL</a> for creating a formal specification which typically morphs into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a>.</p>

<p>I was born in Canada in 1956. I have lived in Jerusalem Israel since 1983. I am married with 4 children, 2B + 2G, plus many grandchildren. I take physical fitness seriously. Once upon a time I was a judoka, and a classical guitarist. I was an IDF reserve soldier for 15 years, where I served as a combat soldier in the infantry in the Jordan Valley. In spite of the fact that I joined the army when I was 32 years old (Hebrew: <em>Shlav Betnik</em>), functionally, but unofficially, I served in the capacity of deputy company commander (Hebrew: <em>Samech Mem Pe</em>) which provided me with the opportunity to achieve rich personal growth, and enabled me to learn important managerial and leadership skills.</p>

It uses <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5510040/designer-reverse-engineers-face-detection-tech-to-develop-camouflage-makeup">digital camouflage</a> that will defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1) Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication (2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying my photo while attempting to associate/label it with any other name besides mine. Similarly if a site were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association or agreement with them, then it is trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to <q>challenge</q> the site by asking me for a verification email.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
