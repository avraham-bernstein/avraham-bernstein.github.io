<p tabindex="0">I have worked for a number of organizations, large and small, and helped them realize improvements in their product performance, often putting them in the front rank in their field. I have acquired expert knowledge in a number of fields, often liaising with noted experts, and have been able to quickly apply this knowledge to improve the competitive position of the companies and their products. I have a keen interest in computer languages and compilers. I have created a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages (DSL)</a> that were instrumental in greatly simplifying seemingly intractable problems.</p>
<p tabindex="0">In order to understand my S/W design principles, see the following appendices (in the full version of my CV):</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="http://purl.org/Avraham.Bernstein/cv/hammelburger/full.html#appendix-programming-languages">Programming Language Preferences and Musings</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="http://purl.org/Avraham.Bernstein/cv/hammelburger/full.html#appendix-dsl">Domain Specific Languages</a></li>

</ul>
<p tabindex="0"><span class="hi">When hiring a senior engineer for a S/W project that has a duration of more than a few months, the most critical requirements are his level of understanding of core programming and architectural concepts, his creativity and innovation track record, and <em>not</em> whether he needs an extra week or two to come up to speed in order to become familiar with the specific programming language and toolchain. For example, note my recent smashing success in the field of <a href="#syntezza">bioinformatics</a>, where even though I had absolutely zero background in the fields of bioinformatics, biology, biochemistry, and genetics, still within 3 months (admittedly with the help of an excellent mentor) I invented a solution for the client that saved them from bankruptcy.</span></p>

<p tabindex="0"><em>@<a href="https://www.viaccess-orca.com/">Viaccess-Orca</a>, Ra’anana - a subsidiary of @Orange France, and @Discretix/<a href="https://www.geektime.com/2015/07/30/arm-acquires-israeli-sansa-security-to-protect-iot-and-cellular-devices/">Sansa Security</a>, Netanya recently acquired by @ARM:</em> See <a href="http://purl.org/Avraham.Bernstein/cv/hammelburger/full.html#viaccess">details</a>. <br>Keys: cybersecurity, DRM, architect, algorithms, anti-reverse engineering, obfuscation, Hex-Rays, OllyDbg, hacking, LLVM compiler, cryptography, data science, big data, fuzzy logic, C/C++, Python, TCL, bash, Java, Android root detection, IOS, Linux, ELF binary editor</p>
<p tabindex="0"><details><summary> The product was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">Over-The-Top (OTT)</a> Internet pay TV system. We provided the S/W infrastructure to our customers, the satellite and cable pay TV operators, so they could also provide an OTT service to their subscribers in order that they could try to compete with <a href="https://www.netflix.com/il-en/">Netflix</a>. The system was designed for small screen Android and IOS devices, i.e. up to 10 inches. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> to encrypt the content.</p>
<p tabindex="0">I was responsible for security policy and security architecture. I worked closely with the product management and the S/W development team leader in order to specify security requirements along with analyzing their costs and benefits. When I specified the architecture of a feature, typically I wrote a working proof-of-concept on account of its complexity. And I was responsible for evaluation, purchase, and configuration of third party tools.</p>
<p tabindex="0"><span class="hi">At the end of my 6 year tenure there were 40M subscribers, and no security breaches.</span> <br><span class="readmore" /></summary></p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">Our workhorse third party tools were the <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-shielding/">InterTrust WhiteCryption</a> <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-shielding/code-protection/">SCP</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscating</a> C/C++ compiler and their <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-shielding/secure-key-box/">SKB</a> <a href="http://www.whiteboxcrypto.com/">white box cryptographic</a> library. I worked very closely with the vendor’s development team because at the time (2014) of our original purchase their SCP obfuscating compiler was new and still had <q>teething pains</q>. They were aware that I had built a similar in-house product for <a href="http://purl.org/Avraham.Bernstein/cv/hammelburger/full.html#nds">NDS</a>, so they were happy to cooperate. Given that it takes 5-10 man-years to create a polished product, and Viaccess-Orca needed the product immediately, and anyway did not have the manpower to build it in-house, therefore the purchase decision was a <q>no brainer</q>.</li>
<li tabindex="0"><em>In many cases the security features that I designed were very complex because their goal was to generate obfuscated binary code in order to prevent reverse engineering, so first I needed to code a working proof-of-concept before finalizing their specifications</em>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed the anti-reverse engineering and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscation</a> programming frameworks and libraries in C/C++. All secure code modules on the device were implemented as native libraries written in C/C++. Typically offline utilites were implemented in Python.</li>
<li tabindex="0">One of my more important and challenging hacks was to generate a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">dynamic share object library (DSO)</a> (i.e. an <code>.so</code> file) that formally exports no symbols - <em>prima facie</em> an <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/oxymoron">oxymoron</a>. In fact I used an asynchronous back channel that allowed the DSO to communicate with its caller by using a function declared with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2053029/how-exactly-does-attribute-constructor-work">gcc constructor attribute</a> that executes before <code>dlopen()</code> returns.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed an Android root detection mechanism using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> techniques. Once the feature was fine tuned, we had zero <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives">false positives</a>, and no known false negatives. Note that the cost of false positives to the operator’s customer support mechanism can be exorbitant. The cost of handling a single call can sometimes be higher than the monthly subscription fee. And flooding the operator’s customer support with thousands of complaints about false accusations of rooted devices could ruin our relationship with our customer, i.e. the operator. Therefore the algorithm had to err on the side of allowing false negatives, i.e. allowing playback on some rooted devices.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Originally the exclusive focus of security was protecting the devices from leaking content and keys, i.e. from being reverse engineered. We relied heavily on the premise that we refused to play on <q>rooted</q> Android devices or <q>jail-broken</q> IOS devices. But when inexpensive rooted Android devices became ubiquitous in the consumer market, the content providers (i.e. the major studios such as Disney, Sony, Warner Bros., etc.) noted a significant drop in their royalty revenues, so they forced us allow playback on rooted devices too. Therefore additional security had to be implemented on the back-end web servers, e.g. to check whether or not a subscriber downloaded an unusually high number of hours of content, or whether the subscriber had simultaneous downloads from different IP addresses. I designed a secure and efficient data logging system. We logged data in order to better understand how subscribers were using the system, and in order to detect piracy. With tens of millions of subscribers, we collected a huge amount of data. I worked with data scientists to design <q>big data</q> collection and analysis techniques. And there was the economic challenge to minimize the communication costs of the data collection program. </details></li>

Before the establishment of OPEC in 1973, the major staple in the Nigerian diet was cassava which was produced via cottage industry. After their huge oil revenues began, the government subsidized wheat. Now that their oil deposits are becoming depleted, and the price seems to be permantently declining, the government can no longer afford the subsidies, so it wants the bakeries to produce bread mixed with 50% cassava. My job was to find and acquire hi-tech infrastructure and agritech products required to build and operate the plantations.</p>
