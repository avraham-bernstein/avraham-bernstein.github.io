<h2 tabindex="0">1.0 Summary</h2>
<p tabindex="0">I am an experienced computer scientist and S/W architect. I have devised innovative solutions to many S/W problems for a wide range of fields, including:</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#viaccess">cybersecurity</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#viaccess">cryptography</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#syntezza">bioinformatics</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#telequest">transportation vehicle route guidance</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#iscar">factory automation</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#elop">automated testing</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#virtouch">blind vision</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#light-pen">accessibility</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#vyyo">telecommunications</a></li>
<li tabindex="0"><a href="#dspg">VLSI CPU design</a></li>
</ul>
<p tabindex="0">I have worked for a number of organizations, large and small, and helped them realize improvements in their product performance, often putting them in the front rank in their field. I have acquired expert knowledge in a number of fields, often liaising with noted experts, and have been able to quickly apply this knowledge to improve the competitive position of the companies and their products. I have a keen interest in computer languages, both practical and theoretical. I have created a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages (DSL)</a> that were instrumental in greatly simplifying seemingly intractable problems.</p>
<p tabindex="0">In order to understand my S/W design principles, see the following appendices:</p>

<section id="it-cobol-adabas-natural-c-ibm-mainframes-and-etl-programming-credentials" class="level3">
<h3 tabindex="0">1.1 IT, Cobol, Adabas, Natural, C#, IBM Mainframes, and ETL Programming Credentials</h3>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0"><span class="hi">This section is admittedly unusual, and may be too difficult for non-technical people to comprehend. So please bear with me. In spite of my best efforts to make it understandable, if you still find it difficult to understand how using my skills would immediately benefit your organization, then please pass my CV on to someone more technical or more senior in your organization who can.</span></li>
<li tabindex="0"><span class="hi">As you can see in my CV, I have no substantive credentials doing IT work, or working with Cobol, Adabas, Natural, C#, or IBM mainframes.</span></li>
<li tabindex="0"><span class="hi">However it should be clear that I am an accomplished computers scientist. I am a <a href="http://www.dictionary.com/browse/polyglot">polyglot</a>. I am an expert in many computer languages, and I comfortably work with many more. I write compilers and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages (DSL)</a> so learning a new language, and being able to work with it at a professional level, usually takes me about a week.</span></li>
<li tabindex="0"><span class="hi">I am an expert in applying templates and macros to any programming language. These macros and templates allow the underlying language to incorporate the latest programming concepts and features while still emitting valid (and human understandable) source code in the original language.</span></li>
<li tabindex="0">Similarly I am very familiar with a number of operating systems.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was the architect of a major soft real-time project in SQL, and I taught a university level course in databases.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Regarding ETL, my compiler background allows me to write conversion filters <q>in my sleep</q>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I am a cybersecurity expert, and therefore have a much better eye for detecting and resolving security issues.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I have a strong theoretical background that allows me to engage in conversion projects of legacy S/W and H/W to modern systems. Everyone in the IT business is aware that the major force driving conversions is that the number of programmers who can maintain legacy systems using the original S/W and H/W is dwindling as they reach retirement age, while few quality graduates are willing to consider entering this field because they don’t want their CV to show that their only experience is using archaic tools and systems.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I have a strong background in automated testing which I have done for telecommunication and military systems.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I am also an economist where the application domain of many IT systems is in fact financial. It helps a great deal to have a strong understanding of the underlying application domain.</li>

<h3 tabindex="0">2011-17: Viaccess-Orca: Security Policy Mngr &amp; Architect: Cybersecurity: OTT Internet Pay TV System</h3>
<p tabindex="0"><em>@<a href="https://www.viaccess-orca.com/">Viaccess-Orca</a>, Ra’anana - a subsidiary of @Orange France, and @Discretix/<a href="https://www.geektime.com/2015/07/30/arm-acquires-israeli-sansa-security-to-protect-iot-and-cellular-devices/">Sansa Security</a>, Netanya recently acquired by @ARM</em> <br>Keys: cybersecurity, DRM, architect, algorithms, anti-reverse engineering, obfuscation, LLVM compiler, cryptography, data science, fuzzy logic, C/C++, Python, TCL, bash, Java, Android root detection, IOS, Linux, ELF binary editor</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">The product was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_content">Over-The-Top (OTT)</a> Internet pay TV system. We provided the S/W infrastructure to our customers, the legacy (i.e. satellite and cable) pay TV operators, so they could also provide an OTT service to their subscribers in order that they could try to compete with <a href="https://www.netflix.com/il-en/">Netflix</a>. The system was designed for small screen Android and IOS devices, i.e. up to 10 inches. We used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">DRM</a> to encrypt the content. Originally the DRM was Microsoft’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayReady">PlayReady</a>, and later on their own proprietary in-house DRM, and finally also Google’s <a href="https://www.widevine.com/wv_drm.html">Widevine</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was responsible for security policy and security architecture. I worked closely with the product management and the S/W development team leader in order to determine security requirements, their costs and benefits, and was the architect of their implementation. In many cases the security features were very complex, so I first needed to create a working proof-of-concept, before finalizing their specifications.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Originally the exclusive focus of security was protecting the devices from leaking content and keys, i.e. from being reverse engineered. We relied heavily on the premise that we refused to play on <q>rooted</q> Android devices or <q>jail-broken</q> IOS devices.</li>
<li tabindex="0">But as time went by, rooted Android devices became inexpensive and ubiquitous in the consumer market. Therefore due to declining royalties, the major studios (e.g. Disney, Sony, Warner Bros., etc.) were economically forced to allow playback on rooted devices. Therefore additional security had to implemented on the back-end web servers, e.g. to check whether or not a subscriber downloaded an unusually high number of hours of content, or whether the subscriber had simultaneous downloads from different IP addresses. I designed a secure and efficient data logging system. We logged data in order to better understand how subscribers were using the system, and in order to detect piracy. With tens of millions of subscribers, we collected a huge amount of data. I worked with data scientists to design <q>big data</q> collection and analysis techniques. And there was the economic challenge to minimize the communication costs of the data collection program.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I specified the anti-reverse engineering and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscation</a> programming frameworks and libraries in C/C++.</li>
<li tabindex="0">My typical development methodology was to first build a prototype for desktop Linux, secondly as a standalone <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> application on the target device, and finally to hand over a working prototype to the development team. Whenever possible I preferred to test on virtual machines.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The challenges of implementing obfuscation are that (1) the other programmers should not be concerned about it because their focus must be on writing correct code, and (2) the resulting increase in size and reduction in run-time speed must not noticeably reduce the usability/functionality of the application. In general the aim of obfuscation is to provide <q>good enough security</q> that will deter 95% of potential attackers, and when combined with regular application updates will force an attacker to begin his next reverse engineering attempt from scratch.</li>
<li tabindex="0">All secure code modules on the device were implemented as native libraries written in C/C++. Typically offline utilites were implemented in Python.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed a lightweight obfuscated cryptographic library implemented as a H file using <code>inline</code> functions so that every module that included it had its own private copy of the library with a module specific randomized implementation which prevented an attack against a single core cryptographic module that could potentially subvert the whole application. Due to performance reasons, there were many cases where we could not afford to use AES, especially during the performance critical movie playback which itself relied upon AES decryption, therefore in these cases we used lightweight algorithms instead, e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xorshift">Xorshift PRNG</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_cipher">stream cipher</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed an Android root detection mechanism using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_logic">fuzzy logic</a> techniques.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed a light weight dynamically randomized method to efficiently shroud all system calls so that their address is calculated just-in-time in registers before the call is made. The technique fooled the professional reverse engineering debuggers <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/">Hex-Rays</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OllyDbg">OllyDbg</a> which normally can automatically identify and place anchors on the system calls.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I created a prototype of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">dynamic shared library (DSO)</a> that formally exported no symbols. In fact it used an asynchronous back channel that allowed the DSO to communicate with its caller by using a function declared with the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2053029/how-exactly-does-attribute-constructor-work">gcc constructor attribute</a> that executes before <code>dlopen()</code> returns. Typically this technique could be applied to <em>binary</em> DSOs from our 3rd party vendors <em>without their knowledge</em>, by doing binary object file <q>surgery</q> (i.e. editing). We were faced with the challenge of securing a critical 3rd party library, i.e. the video <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec">codec</a>, which did not incorporate any obfuscation and where the vendor would not allow us to see or to suggest any modifications to their proprietary source code. They produced a single <q>one size fits all</q> library for all of their clients. Without securing this library, it was an ideal attack vector.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed vector operations for the C preprocessor that allowed a stream cipher to be applied to a constant string <em>pre-compile</em> time that was used to shroud function name strings that were dynamically loaded using <code>dlsym()</code>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was responsible for the purchase decisions and usage policy of 3rd party obfuscation and cryptographic utilities and libraries. The two main 3rd party utilities that we used were the InterTrust WhiteCryption <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-shielding/code-protection/">SCP</a> obfuscating C/C++ compiler and their <a href="https://www.intertrust.com/products/application-shielding/secure-key-box/">SKB</a> <q>whitebox</q> cryptographic library. I worked with the WhiteCryption team to specify new features for their tools. For example, even though their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX">UPX-like</a> tool statically encrypts and packs a DSO, it automatically decrypts it when it is loaded - allowing anyone to load it including an attacker who wants to do reconnaissance, so we added a password protection mechanism using a global operating system object, i.e. an environment variable or a file.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed a post-processor to obfuscate binary object ELF files.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed a background watchdog security thread to dynamically ensure that the binary code had not been tampered with.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed vector operations for the C preprocessor that allowed a stream cipher to be applied to a constant string <em>pre-compile</em> time that was used to shroud function name strings that were dynamically loaded using <code>dlsym()</code>.</li>

<li tabindex="0">One of the most difficult architectural problems was to patch/update the application in a timely manner once a subscriber had already downloaded it. The final application was created by our customers, i.e. the satellite/cable operators. We supplied them with core libraries only. Therefore we did not have access to the enterprise keys from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store that were required to automatically push an update, e.g. to modify a configuration file with a new password due to a security breach on a server. The original security architect naively assumed that we would achieve higher security by building a customer specific version of our core module where we <q>baked</q> (i.e. embedded) in the customer’s keys instead of using a separate customer specific configuration file to be dynamically loaded upon each invocation of the application. The customers were justifiably <q>paranoid</q> about demanding a very high level of quality assurance before making a release, because a single major bug could swamp them with tens of thousands of support calls where the cost of handling a single call could be greater than the monthly subscription fee. Typically their release cycle was every 6-12 months. Therefore the customers would never dare allow us to automatically push code to their subscribers that they did not yet vet. Eventually I architected a technical solution that allowed us to automatically push configuration files to the subscribers where we would givJOBe the customers 7 days prior notice. The solution also required that the servers support two sets of passwords and/or subscriber credentials during a key transition period.</li>

<p tabindex="0"><em>@Self-Startup (defunct), Jerusalem</em> <br>Keys: CTO, biomed, architect, android</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">The simple form of the product was to provide a home diagnostic smartphone app to monitor gait (i.e. walking form). Gait problems often indicate underlying neurological problems, and are a precursor to falls which in the elderly can have serious and even fatal consequences. Gait can be monitored using the accelerometer and gravitation sensor built-in to most smartphones.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The complex form was to detect when the peroneal nerve around the knee <q>misfires</q> causing <q>foot drop</q>. For many people this problem can be corrected by <em>external non-invasive</em> low voltage electrical stimulation to the skin directly above the nerve. <em>FDA approved</em> devices that use this technique cost thousands of dollars. But combined with a smartphone’s built-in accelerometer and gravitation sensor which would detect an impending fall, the extra H/W required to apply the external voltage costs less than $10. We could use H/W similar to that used in adult sexual toys used to provide external low voltage electrical stimulation to the genitals - which BTW do <em>not</em> require FDA approval. Our problem was that the cost of FDA approval for this <em>external non-invasive</em> peroneal nerve stimulation device could cost more than $250K, where the high cost is associated with medically supervised clinical trials. (The FDA is in the <em>process</em> of <q>fast tracking</q> many smartphone health apps, but as of 2017 no <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/09/26/fda-digital-health-apple-fitbit/">small inventors</a> have yet to become eligible). We debated whether to market the system out of China (e.g. using Alibaba) to avoid FDA problems.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I spawned the idea after noticing a colleague at the gym who wore one of these expensive devices because he had degenerative peroneal nerve disease. We collaborated with an orthotics specialist who sells these devices and a MD neurologist who does geriatric research.</li>

<li tabindex="0">I designed and implemented algorithms along with a computational infrastructure for urban traffic vehicle route guidance similar to what <a href="https://www.waze.com/">Waze</a> does today.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I coded in Java. I implemented the simulation infrastructure on the cloud on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The simulations showed that with a guided vehicle penetration rate of just 15%, a very accurate representation of traffic flow could be achieved.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Also the simulations showed that opportunistic guidance algorithms created secondary traffic jams after the penetration rate exceeded 20%. And when the penetration rate exceeded 40%, opportunistic algorithms generated more traffic congestion than using no guidance at all.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Therefore an optimal algorithm had to anticipate traffic flows according to time of day (along with other factors), and to allocate vehicles with similar sources and destinations to different routes in order to avoid secondary traffic jams.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The Java implementation challenge was cost efficiency because the simulations used huge amounts of RAM and ran continuously for days on expensive servers. I could not rely on the efficacy of the built-in memory garbage collector (GC), so I had to explicitly coerce memory allocations and frees.</li>

<li tabindex="0">Inexpensive moisture proof storage bags that can store 500-1000 kg of grain in humid environments with almost no spoilage, whereas previously nearly 75% of the crops placed in field storage facilities were destroyed from moisture induced rot.</li>

<li tabindex="0">Expert on industrial scale cassava processing which was formerly the major food staple in Nigeria before they joined OPEC, and may soon again become their major staple when the oil stops flowing because the government will no longer have the financial resources to subsidize imported wheat.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Cement research expert to consult for the largest cement factory in Africa.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Establish a private local area GSM cell phone tower with a 10 km radius range in order to support a cassava plantation/factory to be built in a remote jungle location where cassava naturally grows. The factory was well outside the geographic regions supported by the local mobile telephone companies.

<h3 tabindex="0">2009-09: Part-time: Consultant: <q>Transparent</q> Technical Negotiator of Restricted Hi-Tech Trade with C</h3>
<p tabindex="0"><em>@Anonymous (defunct), US</em> <br>Keys: hi-tech, business development, negotiator</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy a restricted gyroscope for their super high speed trains from Honeywell that is normally used for ICBMs. I proposed to Honeywell that they insert the gyroscope into the center of a tamper proof lead block that weighed say 50-100 kg. For example if the soft membrane surrounding the gyroscope were penetrated with a blade or drill or laser then it would release acid or a binary explosive. Honeywell would be responsible for developing the tamper proof mechanism. They did not have to reveal to the Chinese how they built the mechanism. All they had to do was to give the Chinese a fixed price quote for the custom work. Clearly such a device could not be used on a missile where every extra gram of weight counts, but where the extra weight was of no consequence to the train. Honeywell agreed.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy the restricted Green Hills real-time operating system. The US government restricts the export of Green Hills <em>source code</em>, but <em>not</em> products that contain Green Hills’ <em>binaries</em>. So I asked Green Hills if I could have the board support package (BSP) developed in Israel which requires access to Green Hills source code, but ship the resulting binaries to China. Green Hills agreed.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The Chinese wanted to buy a drone system from a subsidiary of Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) which was designed for commercial/industrial use. The system had cruise missile like navigation capabilities with the ability to do terrain contour matching. Since the device inherently required GPS navigational capability, I suggested to IAI that they modify their software so that it would not work within 500 km of the Israeli border, along with a back-door jamming channel - due to the fact that it is not uncommon for the Chinese to resell this type of equipment to the Iranians who regularly announce their religious obligation to wipe Israel off the face of the earth.</li>
<li tabindex="0">An Israeli company which develops expensive VLSI design software, e.g. $50-100K per workstation, was afraid that their Chinese agent would cheat them of their royalties. The initial deal was to sell an older version of the software for a one-time flat fee of 20 licenses, in order that the Chinese dealer would be allowed to sell an unlimited number of the older licenses. But I specified how they should re-architect the next version of their software to be converted to Software As A Service (SaaS) on cloud servers. Each licensed subscriber has a workspace on the cloud where the heavy lifting and <q>secret sauce</q> are executed, while the client workstations only act as the UI. It provides excellent security against license theft. For example this is the new economic and technical model that Microsoft Offices 365 uses for the majority of their subscribers which has become one of their most profitable products.</li>

<li tabindex="0">I worked on a wide variety of security related projects. My background task was to do C/C++ <a href="https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/Top+10+Secure+Coding+Practices">code security reviews</a>. Typically secure coding is achieved by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL5o4PFuxTY">adhering to best programming practices</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was a member of the architecture team for their in-house <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)">obfuscating</a> C/C++ compiler.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed techniques using Virtual Machine (VM) technology to crack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management">Digital Rights Management (DRM)</a> schemes.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I developed a technique to subvert a commonly used class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation">random number generators (RNG)</a> that are seeded with the <a href="http://x86.renejeschke.de/html/file_module_x86_id_278.html">X86 CPU clock cycle counter (RDTSC)</a> <a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.

<li tabindex="0">I wrote the technical specification for CCTV (Chinese government TV) to secure the TV feed of the 2008 Beijing Olympic broadcasts against international piracy. We almost won the contract, until Microsoft offered to do it for free.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote business development reports about applying NDS security technology (1) to protect computer games against hacking, and (2) to protect inkjet printers from using 3rd party cartridges.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I arranged for well known security experts to give lectures and seminars at the company. The most successful and well attended course was a one week seminar on reverse engineering X86 assembly code using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OllyDbg">OllyDbg</a>. The course was given by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nezumi">Kris Kaspersky</a> who today (2017) works at Check Point. Afterwards many of us in the security group spent a number of months challenging each other with anti-reverse engineering riddles. The strongest techniques that I developed were (1) jumping into operands of long instructions that were designed to be short opcodes, (2) dynamic creation of opcodes in the heap, and (3) creation of obfuscated FORTH-like virtual machines.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I gave the following 3 well received lectures: (1) how to write code that mitigates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack">side-channel attacks</a>, (2) advanced TCL for the smartcard testing group, and (3) developing a suite of small Posix style utilities that are LEGO-like and easy to interface in unexpected/serendipitous ways versus building large monolithic utilities that are accessible via their GUI only.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I architected and implemented a hybrid simulator/emulator debugger written in C for legacy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box">Set-Top Boxes (STB)</a> that originally could be debugged only with <code>printf</code> statements to log files. My new debugger allowed source code on the PC to be debugged using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Studio">MS Visual Studio IDE</a> debugger while still viewing the results on the STB. Implementation was accomplished by reverse engineering of the STB middleware API. 80% of the middleware ran natively on the PC, while the STB low level H/W specific portions were implemented via an agent on the STB that was accessed via API calls that were implemented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I wrote an automated testing system in TCL and C/C++ for a satellite content delivery system for huge content, e.g. delivering ultra high definition movies to cinemas, and print newspapers for remote publishing. I created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">Domain Specific Language (DSL)</a> in order to execute the satellite operations. After studying the Win32 C/C++ source code of the satellite ground control station, I detected a major conceptual flaw which the architect refused to believe (because testers are not supposed to understand Win32 internals!). So I wrote a progressive test that brought the satellite to its knees at only 25% of its rated capacity. Afterwards the development team used my tool to develop their own unit test scripts, and to execute a system sanity test before checking-in any changes to the source control system.</li>

<p tabindex="0"><em>@<a href="https://www.israel21c.org/graphic-breakthrough-for-the-blind-developed-in-israel/">Virtouch</a> (defunct), Jerusalem</em> <br>Keys: CTO, accessibility, blind, architect, algorithms, GIS, MapML, HTML, SVG, javascript, XSLT, XML Schema, XSLT, C, TCLNDS</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I was the inventor and architect of a system that allowed the blind to to <q>see</q> geographic maps and digital images that were prepared using industry standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system">GIS</a> map descriptions such as <a href="https://maps4html.github.io/MapML/spec/">MapML</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Maps were displayed on a standard HTML browser using HTML, SVG, javascript, XSLT, combined with audio feedback.</li>
<li tabindex="0">A graphics tablet and stylus were used instead of a mouse because the blind can use a tablet much more effectively to navigate the screen compared to a mouse. (Today, 2017, a touch tablet device could be used). The blind have their own sense of hand-eye coordination, and intuitively understand the stylus position on the tablet.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The core design principles were the following:
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">When the mouse/stylus hovers over a pixel or clicks on a pixel (depending upon its mode of operations), the pixel will be conveyed in 3 different sonic dimensions.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The x and y axis are divided into a uniform grid of 72x72 corresponding to a 6 octave 12 note chromatic scale per axis.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The x axis is associated with the first instrument say a piano, while the y axis is associated with the second instrument say a flute, so pixel position is conveyed via playback of 2 simultaneous notes.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Normally volume is associated with the 8-bit gray value of the pixel.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Reduce clutter by allowing the user to dynamically select which map layers to view. Typically visual maps display multiple layers simultaneously. Usually blind users cannot handle viewing multiple layers at once.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Allow the user to dynamically select the level of feature granularity that he wants to view. Think of a topographical map that has an isoline granularity of 100 meters. A blind user may be more comfortable changing the isoline granularity to 500 meters.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Depending upon the mode of operation, the rectangular touch tablet can be mapped into the whole rectangular screen, or into a rectangular window on the screen. The blind very quickly intuitively understand this type of mapping.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Take advantage of SVG’s seamless zooming capability.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">Maps and images were prepared offline using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Schema_(W3C)">XML Schema</a> along with TCL preprocessing.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Note that this application required no custom H/W unlike their expensive (~$300) <a href="http://www.avrahambernstein.com/resources/vtplayer.png">VTPlayer tactile mouse</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0"><span class="hi">I <em>almost</em> saved the company from liquidation. My research was awarded a European FP6 grant of $0.5M Euro that required <em>matching funds</em>. But the investors refused to put up the matching funds due to the company’s long history of financial failure in the children’s Braille education market using their expensive tactile mouse.</span></li>

<h3 tabindex="0">1999-2002: Vyyo: S/W Mngr &amp; Architect: Network: Embedded &amp; Offline Utilities for a <q>Wireless</q> Cable Modem and Router System</h3>
<p tabindex="0"><em>@<a href="https://www.wirelessdesignonline.com/doc/phasecom-changes-name-to-vyyo-0001">Vyyo</a> (defunct), Jerusalem</em> <br>Keys: network, architect, algorithms, SNMP, SNMP-agent, NMS, automated testing, C, TCL, embedded</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I was the architect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Network_Management_Protocol">SNMP</a> network management system (NMS), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_information_base">MIB</a>, and embedded SNMP agent. The workstation NMS was implemented in TCL, and the embedded SNMP agents on the cable modem and router were implemented in C.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I was the architect of a hybrid IP connection for cable modems where there was no physical cable upstream channel. Instead the upstream channel used a telephone modem (ATA), while the downstream channel used the cable modem. Head end network equipment for both interfaces was supplied by the cable operator. My solution was to dynamically modify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">arp table</a> of the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/edge-router">edge router</a>. For typical surfing, the effective downstream rate was as fast as a pure cable solution. The server implementation was in TCL, and the embedded cable modem implementation was in C. The company applied for a provisional patent.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I greatly improved the efficiency of the laboratory modem speed stress testing by a factor of 10-100 by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent">steepest descent</a> search algorithm instead of a binary search algorithm. Reduced testing time per modem from hours to minutes.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a <em>virtual</em> testing lab with 64K modems and 512K PCs by multiplexing the <em>physical</em> connections. The test lab had only 256 <em>physical</em> cable modems, 4 <em>physical</em> PCs with 8 network connections each, 1 cable router, and 2 24-port layer-2 programmable switches. By dynamically editing the PC MAC addresses, and by dynamically editing the MAC filters on the network switches, I was able to fool the router into believing that it faced 64K modems, and to fool the modems into believing that each one was shared by 16 PCs. The Linux workstation implementation was in TCL and C.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a very efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table">hash table</a> algorithm in C for the router’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol">arp table</a> cache, based upon an algorithm I had invented 10 years earlier. The special features of the hash table algorithm were no use of dynamic memory allocations for embedded safety, a unique 2^N table size algorithm that required no use of modulo/division operations for efficiency, and a <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/lifo">LIFO</a> queue in order to gracefully handle table overflow.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a flash memory file system for the modem and router in C.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I designed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type-length-value">TLV</a> configuration file utility both offline for the PC workstation, and embedded on the modem and router in C and TCL.</li>

<p tabindex="0"><em>@Fourfold Technologies (defunct), Jerusalem</em> <br>Keys: gcc C compiler, architect, algorithms, DSL, C/C++, FORTH, LISP, TCL</p>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">This was a very challenging <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc</a> port because the architecture had no registers, or alternatively an infinite number of registers, while RAM access was highly unusual in order to accommodate the 128 cores.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The machine instruction set was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>-like, so it presented unusual optimization challenges, because it was so unlike the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_instruction_set_computer">CISC</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer">RISC</a> instruction sets.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I noted early in the project that the method for emitting target object code was well suited to an object oriented design, even though at the time the gcc compiler collection only interfaced with C code. In order to lower the <q>impedance</q> of using C++, I created a static <q>wrapper</q> for the C++ classes that could interface to the C code that the gcc compiler development framework generated.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The final source code was extremely repetitive. Therefore I developed a preprocessor in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> in order to automatically generate much of the code.</li>

<h3 tabindex="0">1996-96: Part-time: Consulting S/W Engineer: Win32 Improve Performance of a Soft Real-Time Biofeedback Application</h3>
<p tabindex="0"><em>@<a href="http://hms.mindlife.co.il/">MindLife-UltraMind</a>, Jerusalem</em> <br>Keys: Win32, soft real-time, C</p>
<p tabindex="0">I greatly improving the performance and responsiveness of the customer’s relaxation/meditation S/W application by tweaking how their application used the Win32 SDK. But more important, I developed my own meditation technique that uses simple S/W or even no S/W at all, and can easily be taught to most people within 5 minutes. Already in the 1960’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment">brainwave entrainment</a> experiments showed that the brainwaves of cats, for examples, could be controlled by a strobe light source as long as the strobe frequency was within the normal frequency range of the cat’s brain. Now human meditation takes place when the brain is exhibiting <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_activity_and_meditation">theta waves</a> which are in the range of 4-8 Hz. Note that this frequency range is the equivalent of a metronome operating at frequency of 240-480 beats per minute (bpm). Normally mechanical metronomes don’t operate at speeds higher than 180 bpm, but today (2017) there are many free digital metronome applications (on smartphones, tablets, and desktop PCs) that operate at much higher speeds, where 240-360 bpm is the <q>sweet spot</q> for meditation. My favorite application is <a href="http://www.antcom.de/gtick/">GNU GTick</a>. I use the following 3 settings:</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">240 bpm (= 4 Hz), 4/4 time</li>
<li tabindex="0">300 bpm (= 5 Hz), 5/4 time</li>
<li tabindex="0">360 bpm (= 6 Hz), 6/4 time</li>
</ul>
<p tabindex="0">The application has a strong first beat option in case you lose synchronization, and it also has the option of a visual mode that synchronizes with the audio. By keeping time with the metronome app, your brainwave frequency synchronizes to the metronome frequency, which by definition puts you into a meditative state. And after a little bit of practice, many people can simply watch a clock with a second hand that makes a single discrete jump every second, and silently count to 4, 5, or 6 per jump, which is equivalent to frequencies of 4, 5, and 6 Hz respectively.</p>

<ol>
<li tabindex="0">The client’s project was the fire control system for the Night Hawk laser guided missiles.</li>
<li tabindex="0">My task was to create an architecture and implementation of the automated test procedures dictated by the US DOD. The test specification documentation was over 1 meter high.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Additionally there would be many <em>ad hoc</em> tests that would be required during the development process.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The test equipment included external voltage regulators, external heating and cooling equipment, vibrators, etc.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The workstation controlling the tests was a Windows NT PC.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Instead of creating a monolithic test program in C/C++, I created a BASIC-like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a> with special C++ drivers for controlling the various pieces of H/W.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I implemented the BASIC compiler using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yacc">lex/yacc</a> and C++.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I made this critical architectural decision because the test specification manual was being regularly revised, plus I needed the flexibility to allow the <em>non-programmer</em> system engineers to write their own scripts without delving into the underlying C++ code. And I wanted to avoid having the client call me every time he needed to implement a minor/trivial change that he could easily learn to do himself.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The standard tests were presented via a GUI which in fact emitted BASIC script.</li>
<li tabindex="0">The system worked as planned. Unsupervised tests ran successfully for up to 72 hours (over holidays).</li>
<li tabindex="0">Post mortem: The first version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a> was released just around the time of this project, i.e. <em>pre-Internet</em>. Once I learned about TCL, I immediately realized it would have been the ideal platform for creating the test environment. Instead of me having to create my own BASIC-like language with control structures and variable handling, I could have relied upon TCL, and simply added custom primitives for the various pieces of H/W.</li>

<li tabindex="0">Iscar Matkash in Tefen IL is a fully automated factory that produces thousands of different cutting blades using a sintering process. The raw materials go through many stages of operations. In many cases after undergoing intermediate processing, the partially processed material can still be diverted to multiple final products - similar to stem cells. The factory contains hundreds of automated workstations, stands, stacks, guided vehicles, and conveyor belts. The product or intermediate product is placed on pallets. The pallets are moved from one stand on a workstation to a stand on another workstation, or temporarily to a storage stand or stack.</li>
<li tabindex="0">My task was to create a computer program that automatically operated/orchestrated the factory.</li>
<li tabindex="0">When my co-architect and I started this project, we had zero background in industrial engineering. We were supplied with a mentor who brought us up to speed.</li>

<p tabindex="0">Because I have a strong background in compilers, I am knowledgeable in many computer languages, and I can learn a new language at an expert level very quickly.</p>
<p tabindex="0">My <q>go to</q> language for low level programming is C while still taking advantage of modern programming paradigms (i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)">encapsulation</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition">composition</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_(object-oriented_programming)">interface</a> as opposed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)">inheritance</a>). The advantage of using C is that it is the universal interface language.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Where projects demand it, I can write C++ well too, but I am much more aware than the average programmer of its potential pitfalls, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">brittle and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming)">tightly coupled</a> object hierarchies</li>

<h2 tabindex="0">Appendix B: Domain Specific Languages (DSL)</h2>
<section id="b.1-dsl-what-and-why" class="level3">
<h3 tabindex="0">B.1: DSL What and Why</h3>
<p tabindex="0">First of all, here is the Wikipedia entry for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific languages (DSL)</a>.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Consider a GUI calculator app. It is not convenient to manually enter thousands of calculations. Similarly <q>fuzzing</q> the app, i.e. automatically testing it for corner conditions, will require that thousands of possibilities be tested. Most GUI apps are automatically tested by simulating low level UI events, e.g. mouse movement and button events, and individual key stroke events. These low level UI events have no semantic meaning <em>per se</em>. And if the UI layout were to change then a test program based upon UI events would have to redesigned. It would be much much easier to use this app for batch processing by starting off with all the data in a text file say in a simple CSV (spreadsheet) format. If the GUI calculator app were built to emit script acceptable to the venerable Linux <code>bc</code> CLI calculator app, then it would be trivial to automate it. And for a larger and more complex GUI app with lots of menus and dynamic dialog boxes, interpreting UI events is much more difficult.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Now consider the venerable Linux <code>gdb</code> debugger which has a built-in CLI. Most GUI debugger apps on Linux are in fact front ends for <code>gdb</code>. It is usually not too difficult to write a huge <code>gdb</code> script which can be used to fuzz individual functions inside a large executable program (as long as it is compiled with debug symbols).</p>
<p tabindex="0">In general an app’s GUI should be a wrapper for the underlying app’s CLI. The GUI should emit CLI script. This way it is easy to record user GUI events. The app can be used in batch mode. And it is straightforward to write an automated testing suite for the app.</p>
<p tabindex="0">When specifying an architecture for a large system, it is preferable to create a DSL that describes all aspects of how the system is supposed to behave. This DSL formalizes the architecture, and provides the groundwork for automated testing.</p>
<p tabindex="0">The app’s CLI should include end user definable control structures (i.e. condition and loop handling), along with the ability to define procedures, variables, and data structures. Embedded language frameworks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">FOSS</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a> and <a href="http://ficl.sourceforge.net/">FICL</a> (i.e. an embeddable FORTH) provide this infrastructure for free. In fact these relatively small frameworks, i.e. with a memory footprint of 50-100 KB, usually grossly simplify the CLI design. Now an argument to a CLI method can take a numeric expression without the necessity of the programmer to understand anything at all about the complexity of writing a numeric expression parser. The framework allows an end user to create his own macros, test conditions, and write loops. An app with a CLI can be <q>glued</q> together with many other unrelated apps, just like the hundreds of Posix text utilities, and used in many unexpected but very useful ways - as opposed to a GUI-only interface which greatly limits how an app can interface with other apps.</p>

<h3 tabindex="0">B.2: DSL How To</h3>
<section id="b.2.1-dsl-simple-via-jinja2" class="level4">
<h4 tabindex="0">B.2.1: DSL Simple via Jinja2</h4>
<p tabindex="0">Most languages have mediocre or non-existent generic, macro, and template facilities but I can get around these limitations by wrapping most any language using the superb <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/">Jinja2</a> template/macro language as a preprocessor. Google uses Jinja2 in this way for its flagship <a href="https://www.chromium.org/developers/jinja">Chromium</a> project. My first step before designing a full-fledged DSL is to determine whether or not Jinja2 can be gently coerced to do a good enough job.</p>
<p tabindex="0">For example, consider a long repetitive declarative configuration file, that could be greatly simplified and shortened by using Jinja2 templates.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Or consider the C language built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor">cpp macro preprocessor</a> which is very simplistic. It has no template support. There is no <em>pre-compilation</em> support for arithmetic or string operations, array index selection, execution of O/S shell commands, and there is no straightforward way to implement loops, while complex macros with many levels of calls can often be incorrectly considered to be recursive which abort without even an error message. Once upon a time the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M4_(computer_language)">m4 macro processor</a> would be the tool of choice to implement complex macros. It has an arcane syntax, but it is admittedly Turing complete. Today very sophisticated Jinja2 macros and templates can be wrapped to look like cpp macros. This wrapping is important because most modern C/C++ IDEs have language sensitive editors that will choke when encountering invalid C/C++ syntax. Therefore the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile">Makefile</a> implementation strategy is to first execute cpp (i.e. <code>gcc -E</code>), followed by Jinja2, followed by gcc.</p>
<p tabindex="0">The following is an example of a Jinja2 macro <code>J2_ABC</code> that executes a python function that can be declared in a C/C++ file, and will keep the language sensitive IDE happy. Because some IDEs with smart language sensitive editors interpret cpp macros during an editing session, there must be 2 modes of operation, (1) build mode that will emit Jinja2/Python code, and (2) IDE mode that will emit default syntactically valid C/C++ code.</p>

<section id="b.2.2-dsl-full-fledged" class="level4">
<h4 tabindex="0">B.2.2: DSL Full-fledged</h4>
<p tabindex="0">When writing a full-fledged DSL, unless run-time efficiency or a binary target is critically important, I tend to shy away from using formal compiler frameworks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_bison">flex/bison</a>, <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a>, <a href="https://llvm.org/">LLVM</a>, etc., because they are complex and have a relatively steep learning curve.</p>
<p tabindex="0">In my experience most DSLs require a limited number of domain specific verbs and data structures. The rest of the language such as control structures (e.g. conditions and loops), and procedure, variable, and data structure definitions, which are by far the most difficult and time consuming to develop, can piggyback upon the built-in features of extensible languages such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">TCL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)">Lua</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)">FORTH</a>, etc.</p>
<p tabindex="0">Where the implementation will be a standalone CLI, my first choice is to use TCL. And if the TCL app also needs a GUI then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tk_(software)">Tcl/Tk</a> widget toolkit can be used to simply and quickly produce a GUI - admittedly not the most elegant, but usually good enough. However when third party packages are needed to support the language (e.g. mathematical, scientific, and AI libraries etc.) then Python is required. Admittedly there are at least 100 times more Python programmers than TCL programmers, so even though it usually requires significantly less code to create a standalone CLI app in TCL, from the client’s perspective of future maintainability, it is often more cost effective to spend the extra initial effort to build the app in Python.</p>
<p tabindex="0">And where the implementation will be embedded inside another application then Lua is the easiest to understand for most end users, but where minimizing code footprint and maximizing execution speed are more important then <a href="http://ficl.sourceforge.net/">FORTH/FICL</a> is required.</p>

<h2 tabindex="0">Appendix C: How To Write Correct, Maintainable, Secure, and Easy-to-Test Code</h2>
<ol>
<li tabindex="0">I design applications that can be dynamically configured and automatically tested via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface">CLI</a> script.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">Ideally the CLI definition should already be part of the architectural specification of an application <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">domain specific language (DSL)</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Ideally the CLI should be wrapped with an industry standard light weight embedded interpreter such as <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> or <a href="http://ficl.sourceforge.net/">FORTH/FICL</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Tip: In debug mode <em>only</em>, the interpreter should be allowed to invoke O/S shell commands.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">I design modules with built-in test points.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">I write CLI scripts to access and to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing">fuzz</a> these test points.</li>
<li tabindex="0">This technique promotes simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">regression testing</a>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">My preferred GUI design is to have it generate CLI script - as opposed to directly invoking internal functions.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">This allows GUI actions to be <em>semantically</em> captured as opposed to capturing low level GUI events (e.g. individual mouse and keystroke events), and allows functional testing to be independent of the GUI.</li>
<li tabindex="0">And it allows large test and configuration scenarios to be first sketched with the GUI, and then to be extended with a text editor.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">Especially in languages such as C/C++ that use manual memory management, using a tool such as <a href="http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a> to discover memory leaks is critically important.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I liberally use both static and dynamic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)">assertions</a> in my source code which are especially important during initial development. I am a big fan of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_contract">design by contract</a> paradigm.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)">lint</a>, and I heavily make use of compiler attributes that enforce safe code.</li>
<li tabindex="0">I design my code to minimize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_complexity">complexity</a> in order to reduce bugs and make it easier to maintain. I analyze my code with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic complexity (McCabe)</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures">Halstead complexity</a> metrics.</li>
<li tabindex="0">Never release code when the build process generates compiler warnings.
<ul>
<li tabindex="0">I have worked on too many projects where the build process generates hundreds of thousands of compiler warnings. In such a situation it is nearly impossible to determine which warnings are serious, so in fact all warnings are ignored.</li>
</ul></li>
<li tabindex="0">A necessary condition for secure code is that the code first must be correct. See the Google Tech-Talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eL5o4PFuxTY">The Lazy Programmer’s Guide To Computer Security</a>.</li>
<li tabindex="0">And after all of the above techniques have been incorporated into the implementation, still the most efficient way to flush out 50% of the bugs is an informal code review with a colleague where the programmer must explain every line of his code. Typically during his explanation, the programmer has many <q>aha</q> moments when recognizing many of his own bugs.</li>

<li tabindex="0" id="fn1"><p tabindex="0">This secure photo was built using an <a href="http://docs.gimp.org/en/plug-in-oilify.html">oilify</a> filter and a visible email address <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_watermarking">watermark</a>. It uses <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/5510040/designer-reverse-engineers-face-detection-tech-to-develop-camouflage-makeup">digital camouflage</a> that will defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1) Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication (2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying my photo while attempting to associate/label it with any other name besides mine. Similarly if a site were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association or agreement with them, then it is trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to <q>challenge</q> the site by asking me for a verification email.<a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p></li>
