<h3>1. Torah &amp; Yisrael: Political Correctness "Trigger Warning"</h3>
<details>
<summary>
1) My <em>Aliyah</em>, i.e. immigration to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em> (English: the Land of Israel)
</summary>
<ul>
<li>I came on <em>Aliyah</em> in 1983 from the US. I came with my wife and my two oldest then
infant children. I had a university degree, a few years experience in hi-tech, and enough money
to make a down payment on an apartment. I understood if I were to wait even a few years, and
took out a mortgage on a home, then it was unlikely that I would ever leave the <em>Golden
Medina</em>.</li>
<li>I have always lived in <em>Yerushalayim</em> (English: Jerusalem). <em>Har Habayit</em>
(English: the Temple Mount) is the navel of the world from which the <em>Shechina</em> (English:
God's presence) eminates throughout the world.</li>
<li>For an observant God-fearing Jew, the ultimate place to live is in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.
For the past 2000 years, every year at the end of the Passover <em>Seder</em>, every Jewish
family chants the prayer <em>next year in Jerusalem</em>. With the advent of the Zionist
movement, <em>Aliyah</em> began in earnest about 1880. Until the 1960's it was physically
difficult to live in Israel. But by the time I came in 1983, even though at the time the
standard of living was much less than in North America, still one could expect to live a long
healthy and fulfilling life in the modern State of Israel.</li>
<li>Now (in 2025) I have no regrets moving to Israel. The transformation is as <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt26c6.htm">if we were in a dream (Psalm 126)</a>. The
values and life style of my children and grandchildren are so much better than my North American
friends and relatives. Israel's standard of living is one of the highest in the world.
Professionally I live at the pinnacle of the hi-tech world. It is sad but true, that many
progressive people in the West hate the Jewish People, but I am proud to be a member of a
righteous and just nation, even if we are forced to "dwell alone". And it is clear to any
objective person, that we are living in the footsteps of the <em>Mashiach</em> (English:
Messiah). The ancient prophesies are being fulfilled before our eyes.</li>
<li>Unfortunately since the delusional Olso "peace accords" in 1993 there were many divisions in
Israeli society, between religious, secular, left, and right. Most of these divisions are now
disappearing since the Oct. 7 Hamas massacres. The process was painful, but Israeli society is
now healing and maturing, and most are becoming much more aware that <em>HaShem</em> is the
<em>Ribono Shel Olam</em> (English: Master of the Universe).</li>

2) The scientific evidence for Divine creation, according to the <a
href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/nahmanides-ramban/">Ramban's (c. 1250 CE)</a>
commentary on the first chapter of the book of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis">Genesis</a>, <a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Genesis-Big-Bang-Discovery-Harmony/dp/0553354132">Gerald
Schroeder's book "Genesis and the Big Bang"</a>, and <a
href="https://ktav.com/products/in-the-beginning">Nathan Aviezer's book "In the Beginning:
Biblical Creation and Science"</a>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>About 800 years ago the <em>Ramban</em> described the ancient Rabbinic tradition that the
only thing that <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/">HaShem</a> actually
created <em>ex nihilo</em> were atomic particles (Greek: <em>Hyla</em>, Hebrew: <em>Tohu
VeBohu</em>) which were used to subsequently form all other elements in the universe including
stars, planets, plants, animals, and Man, etc. <em>HaShem</em> compressed this chaotic mass of
particles into a dark object the size of a mustard seed for an unknown period of time. Creation
began when <em>HaShem</em> caused this object to explode, scattering the particles throughout
the universe, and then light appeared. This is identical to the description of the "Big Bang"
theory that is now accepted by all modern astrophysicist cosmologists for the past 60
years.</li>
<li>The <em>Ramban</em> refers to each "day" of creation as an <em>epoch</em> (Hebrew:
<em>Tekufa</em>). On each new day <em>HaShem</em> injected massive changes into the universe.
Darwinian "evolutionary" theory cannot account for the explosive changes in life after each new
day. Each new day increased the "order" in the universe, i.e. reduced <em>entropy</em>. The
Hebrew expression <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0101.htm">and it was evening and it
was morning (Gen. 1:5)</a> (Hebrew: <em>Vayehi Erev Vayehi Voker</em>) that closes each day of
creation alludes to this increase in order. The <em>Ramban</em> states that the root meaning of
the word "evening" (Hebrew: <em>Erev</em>) is derived from the Hebrew <em>Ta'arovet</em>
(English: "an unordered mixture"), while the word "morning" (Hebrew: <em>Boker</em>) is derived
from the Hebrew <em>Mevukar</em> (English: "ordered").</li>
<li><em>HaShem's</em> ultimate act of creation was modern Man on the 6th day, on <em>Rosh
Hashanna</em> 5785 years ago, which conforms to the archeological time frame of the beginning of
civilization, history, and writing. Since then the passage of time is as we now know it. This
transformation happened nearly simultaneously worldwide wherever civilization existed from
Mesopotamia, the Nile Delta, the Indus Valley, the Mekong Delta, the Yellow River Valley, etc.
Don't fool yourselves. The psychology of modern Man has not changed since this time.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<p>

<summary>
3) The reason why <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/">HaShem</a> chose
the Jews, along with <em>His</em> primary directive to the Jewish People <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm">to keep the ways of <em>HaShem</em>, to execute
righteousness and justice (Gen. 18:19)</a>
</summary>
<ul>
<li>In our time (i.e. 2025) the world is witnessing (1) the fulfillment of this directive when
the Jewish People who <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0423.htm">dwells alone (Num.
23:9)</a> in this world will <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0423.htm">rise up like a
lioness (Num. 23:24)</a> to devour evil, and (2) the moral bankruptcy of the <em>Abrahamic</em>
"supercessionist" (aka replacement) theologies.</li>
<li>The supercessionists have a highly flawed understanding of "ethical monotheism". Islam,
while being monotheistic, worships <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_God_Who_Hates">A God
Who Hates</a>. The <em>Quran</em> openly states that their God sanctions murder, pillaging,
piracy, and slavery. Christianity, with highly suspect monotheistic credentials (i.e. their
belief in the Trinity), <a
href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/the_danger_of_legalism.htm">fundamentally cannot accept
that ethical behavior requires adherence to God's laws</a>, and cannot accept that evil often
requires force to be eradicated.</li>
</ul>

historian Arnold Toynbee whether or not the Jewish People are in a state of <a

<p>a. The Oct. 7 <a
href="https://www.catholicsforisrael.com/images/stories/nova_buddha.webp">"rave" dancers
undulated under a statue of Budda</a> while the majority of believing Jews <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-825795">danced in front of Torah scrolls on the
night of <em>Simchat Torah</em></a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were engaged in the cardinal sin of idolatry exactly like those who danced in front of
the <a href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/golden-calf">Golden Calf</a> about 3400 years
ago, who <em>HaShem</em> ordered to be killed on account of their offense. I feel that nearly
all of the dancers were aware of the gravity of their offense, but they had a tenuous connection
to the "quaint" beliefs of Judaism. Their apologists claim that no reasonable person believes in
idols anymore, or in any god at all. Anyway, they just wanted to have "fun".</li>
<li>On the other hand, when the Hamas barbarians murdered hundreds of them in the morning, many
were heard screaming <em>Shema Yisrael</em> which is what traditional Jews have screamed since
time immemorial when they were being murdered <em>Al Kiddush HaShem</em> (English: for
sanctifying God's name).</li>
</ul>
<p>b. The <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haredim-charedim/">Hareidi</a>
theological advocacy of draft evasion during our existential war against the Hamas Islamofascist
barbarians:</p>
<ul>
<li>Their behavior is indefensible. Their excuses are nonsensical. They argue about the danger
of secularization if they were to join the IDF, yet almost half of the IDF's ground forces are
religious Zionists, who are on the front lines, and who volunteer for the most dangerous
missions in this war because they inherently understand the theological significance for which
we are fighting.</li>
<li>The <em>hareidim</em> have not yet fully theologically accepted the establishment of the
secular State of Israel, therefore many would prefer to live in the Diaspora which is a
fundamental denial of the core belief in Judaism according to <a
href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/nahmanides-ramban/">Ramban's</a> commentary on
the first verse of the <em>Torah</em> (Gen. 1:1). However 90 years ago the Nazi fascists, and
now the current worldwide support of the the Islamofascists, are forcing most Jews to seriously
consider <em>Aliyah</em>.</li>
<li>The <em>hareidim</em> are incapable of publicly admitting and praising <em>HaShem's</em>
miracles that make it possible for us to live and to thrive in <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>. They
refuse to acknowledge the recent miraculous victory over Iran, nor the miraculous victory over
the Arab armies in 1967, nor how land is blooming after 2000 years of desolation. This grave sin
is referred to as lack of <em>HaKaret HaTov</em> (English: thanks).</li>
<li>And just this month (July 2025) the <em>hareidi</em> leadership has achieved a new nadir. In
the <em>Knesset</em> (English: parliament) they are preventing the expulsion of an Arab
<em>MK</em> (English: member of <em>Knesset</em>), <em>Ayman Odeh</em>, who has publicly praised
the Hamas barbarians, who inflicted the largest massacre of Jews since the <em>Sho'ah</em>
(English: Nazi Holocaust). The difference between the <em>hareidim</em> and the crazy marginal
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neturei_Karta">Neturia Karta</a> sect, who publicly
support the Iranian denial of the <em>Sho'ah</em>, has become microscopic.</li>
<li>I pray that <em>HaShem</em> will publicly shame the leaders of the <em>hareidi</em>
community.</li>
</ul>
<p>c. So-called "pride" "LGBTQ+" marches in the streets of <em>Yerushalayim</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>About 3400 years ago, <em>Hashem</em> revealed the <em>Torah</em> to the Jewish People at
Mount Sinai 7 weeks after <em>HaShem</em> miraculously liberated them from hundreds of years of
Egyptian bondage. The revelation was an extraordinary event. <em>Hashem</em> instructed the Jews
to uphold a new ethical legal system that reflected that Man was created in the image of God. It
was a radical revolutionary concept for the ancient world that still required thousands of years
for Man, at least in the Western world, to subsequently digest.</li>
<li>Among other things, the <em>Torah</em> forbids deviant sexual behavior, i.e. adultery,
incest, beastiality, and <strong>homosexuality</strong> - see <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm">Lev. 18:1-30</a> which is read during the
<em>Yom Kippur</em> service in order to emphasize the fundamental depravity of these offenses.
People who proudly display such deviancy, even the few who have <em>bona fide</em> psychological
or physical urges, are spitting in <em>HaShem's</em> face - regardless of the current fad of
political correctness.</li>
<li>Unfortunately in the State of Israel, in the name of "freedom of expression", the so-called
"legal system" encourages such behavior even though it is reprehensible to the vast majority of
the population. These so-called "judges" would never allow anyone to publicly defecate on the
Israeli flag on Independence Day, but they have no qualms allowing someone to defecate on the
<em>Torah</em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>Oslo was not a "noble experiment" that "just happened" to fail. The primary perpetrators,
<em>Shimon Peres</em> and <em>Yossi Beilin</em>, <strong>intentionally designed it to
fail!</strong> It must never be forgotten that Oslo enabled the so-called Gaza "Disengagement"
which paved the way for the <em>Hamas</em> barbarians to rule Gaza.</li>

9) 1995-96: My <strong>successful</strong> challenge of the IDF's illegal rules of engagement at
the Supreme Court during the height of the Oslo lunacy
</summary>
<ul>
<li>An IDF general (i.e. Ilan Biran, the then <em>Aluf Pikud HaMerkaz</em>), ordered me, in
front of other soldiers, to refrain from preemptively defending myself when a Palestinian
terrorist aimed his rifle at me (or at other soldiers or at civilians) until
<strong>AFTER</strong> the bullet left the terrorist's rifle! Also Biran predicted how the new
era of "peace" would eliminate the need for an IDF presence in the Jordan Valley even while
Arafat was blowing up buses in <em>Yerushalayim</em> while he was speaking!</li>
<li>For his fealty to the so-called "peace process", and concomitant lack of concern for the
lives of his soldiers, the Oslo government subsequently rewarded Biran by appointing him as
Director General of the Ministry of Defense, and later as chairman of government controlled
corporations, i.e. <em>Israel Oil Refineries</em>, <em>Bezeq</em>, and <em>Yes</em>.</li>
<li>Unfortunately after 30 years of the fake peace rigidly enforced by a fake legal system that
ignored the associated massive corruption required to make it work, <em>HaShem</em> overwhelmed
the Jewish People with the Oct. 7 massacres, which immediately woke up the vast majority of
Israeli Jews from their stupor. I call this "baseball bat to the head" therapy. According to
ancient Jewish tradition already stemming from the time of the Egyptian bondage, nothing happens
to the Jewish People, whether good or bad, that is not dictated by <em>HaShem</em> - see <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm">Gen. 15:13</a>.</li>

2023 Jerusalem: Rescued an extremely bright autistic teen from being declared truant and
forcibly sent to an institution for emotional retards due to malicious negligence by the
Ministry of Education
</summary>
<p>
The boy had been learning successfully in a top school (i.e. <em>Machon Lev</em> highschool),
but started having problems during <em>Covid</em> when he was forced to be schooled at home. We
achieved victory by sending the boy to be evaluated by the world renowned <a
href="https://feuerstein-institute.org/">Feuerstein Institute</a> who specialize in the
treatment of people, especially of children, who don't act normally. Their evaluation confirmed
that he was extremely bright. The ministry was simply too lazy to provide him with an assistant
which they were legally obligated to do. Finally when they did provide him with an assistant,
the ministry maliciously instructed the assistant to attempt to convince the boy to drop out of
school.

2016-19 Jerusalem: Rescued 3 young children at family court from foster care when the Ministry
of Social Services maliciously and falsely accused the father (my wife's relative) of being a
pedophile when in fact I showed that his young daughter was serially molested in locked-down
institutions run by Social Services
</summary>
<p>
Even though we eventually won our case which is highly unusual when social services declares the
father to be a pedophile, the most depressing element was that the judge presiding over this
trial became aware that the senior social services youth officer was committing perjury, and
that the court appointed legal guardian of the children was aware of this perjury yet remained
silent, yet the judge never criminally sanctioned his "colleagues" with whom he worked for many
years in the family court system. The deputy legal advisor for the ministry refused to get
involved in our case. And our expensive attorney who initially promised that he would advocate
that they be charged with contempt and perjury, eventually backed down by saying that we should
just be extremely grateful for the outcome.

1) My 3 min. course to teach deep meditation just by using a clock with a second hand
</summary>
<p>
Bottom line, a meditative state is achieved when your brain wave frequency is about 5 Hz, i.e. 5
beats per second or 300 beats per minute. If you can count to 5 in your mind every second of a
clock for at least 15 consecutive seconds, or follow a metronome app that is set to 300 bpm,
then you are in a deep meditative state. The better metronome apps usually provide both sound
and visual feedback. Here is an excellent free Android <a
href="https://stonekick.com/metronome.html">metronome app</a>. The best learning technique is to
<strong>synchronize</strong> the sound and visual feedback. Initially most people can handle
180-240 bpm. With practice you can achieve 300.
</p>
<p>
Another, but indirect meditation technique, is via your phone's pulse app, typically measured by
monitoring the blood flow through your finger or thumb by shining the camera's light into it. A
pulse of 54 or less is indicative of deep meditation. You will need to control your breathing in
order to achieve this low pulse rate.

75-90% of your theoretical maximum heart rate, i.e 220-YourAge; for example if you are 70 then
your theoretical maximum is 150=220-70 bpm; I personally engage in 30 minutes of intensive

<li><p>daily walks for 15-30 minutes, ideally 2x per day</p></li>
<li><p>daily stretching or yoga</p></li>
<li><p>lift weights that exercise various muscle groups that are <em>heavy for you</em>, 2x per
week which increases bone density and can <a

<li>consuming calcium rich foods or medication, which are stored in your liver, <strong>will
