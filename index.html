<li><em>Torah</em> &amp; <em>Yisrael</em>:
<ul>
<li>My <em>Aliyah</em>, i.e. immigration to <em>Eretz Yisrael</em>.</li>
<li>The scientific evidence for divine creation, according to the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides">Ramban's (c. 1250 CE)</a> commentary on the
first two chapters of the book of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis">Genesis</a>, <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Schroeder">Gerald Schroeder's book "Genesis and the
Big Bang"</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Aviezer">Nathan Aviezer's book
"In the Beginning: Biblical Creation and Science"</a>.</li>
<li>The reason why <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/">HaShem</a> chose
the Jews, along with <em>His</em> primary directive to the Jewish People <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm">to keep the ways of <em>HaShem</em>, to execute
righteousness and justice (Gen. 18:19)</a>: In our time (i.e. 2025) the world is witnessing (1)
the fulfillment of this directive when the Jewish People stand alone in the world to rise up
like a lioness to devour evil, and (2) the moral bankruptcy of the <em>Abrahamic</em>
"supercessionist" (aka replacement) theologies. The supercessionists have a highly flawed
understanding of "ethical monotheism". Islam, while being monotheistic, worships <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_God_Who_Hates">A God Who Hates</a>. They openly admit that
their God approves murder, pillaging, piracy, and slavery. Christianity, with highly suspect
monotheistic credentials (i.e. their belief in the Trinity), <a
href="https://biblehub.com/topical/t/the_danger_of_legalism.htm">fundamentally cannot accept
that ethical behavior requires adherence to God's laws</a>, and cannot accept that evil often
requires force to be eradicated.</li>
<li>Review of the 1961 debate between Israeli Ambassador Rav Yaakov Herzog and Oxford historian
Arnold Toynbee whether or not the Jewish People are in a state of <a
href="https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judaism%3B_Fossil_or_Ferment%2C_Preface.1?lang=en">fossil or
ferment</a>.</li>
<li>Wars against Hamas and Iranian Islamofascist barbarians.</li>

<ol>
<li>The Oct. 7 <a
href="https://www.catholicsforisrael.com/images/stories/nova_buddha.webp">"rave" dancers under a
statue of Budda</a> while the majority of believing Jews <a
href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-825795">danced in front of Torah scrolls on
<em>Simchat Torah</em></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haredim-charedim/">Hareidi</a> draft
evasion during an existential war: Their behavior is indefensible. Their excuses are
nonsensical. Just like we witnessed a miraculous victory over the Iranians, I pray that one day
soon <em>HaShem</em> will publicly call their leadership to account for their disgusting
behavior.</li>
<li>So-called "pride" "LGBTQ+" marches in the streets of <em>Yerushalayim</em>: About 3400 years
ago, <em>Hashem</em> revealed the <em>Torah</em> to the Jewish People at Mount Sinai 7 weeks
after <em>HaShem</em> miraculously liberated them from hundreds of years of Egyptian bondage.
The revelation was an extraordinary event. <em>Hashem</em> instructed the Jews to uphold a new
ethical legal system that reflected that Man was created in the image of God. It was a radical
revolutionary concept for the ancient world that still required thousands of years for Man, at
least in the Western world, to subsequently digest. Among other things, the <em>Torah</em>
forbids deviant sexual behavior, i.e. adultery, incest, beastiality, and
<strong>homosexuality</strong> - see <a href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0318.htm">Lev.
18:1-30</a> which is read during the <em>Yom Kippur</em> service in order to emphasize the
fundamental depravity of these offenses. People who proudly display such deviancy, even the few
who have <em>bona fide</em> psychological or physical urges, are spitting in <em>HaShem's</em>
face - regardless of the current fad of political correctness. Unfortunately in the State of
Israel, in the name of "freedom of expression", the so-called "legal system" encourages such
behavior even though it is reprehensible to the vast majority of the population. These so-called
"judges" would never allow anyone to publicly defecate on the Israeli flag on Independence Day,
but they have no qualms allowing someone to defecate on the <em>Torah</em>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The massive uptick in so-called "progressive" antisemitism in the Western world: I pray that
we will soon see the fulfillment of the prophecy <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0424.htm">blessed be those who bless <em>Yisrael</em>, and
cursed be those who curse <em>Yisrael</em> (Num. 24:9)</a>.</li>
<li>The Oslo so-called "peace process" fiasco. Oslo was not a "noble experiment" that "just
happened" to fail. The primary perpetrators, <em>Shimon Peres</em> and <em>Yossi Beilin</em>,
<strong>intentionally designed it to fail!</strong> It must never be forgotten that Oslo enabled
the so-called Gaza "Disengagement" which paved the way for the <em>Hamas</em> barbarians to rule
Gaza.</li>
<li>1995-96: My <strong>successful</strong> challenge of the IDF's illegal rules of engagement
at the Supreme Court during the height of the Oslo lunacy: An IDF general (i.e. Ilan Biran, the
then <em>Aluf Pikud HaMerkaz</em>), ordered me, in front of other soldiers, to refrain from
preemptively defending myself when a PA terrorist aimed his rifle at me (or at other soldiers or
at civilians) until <strong>AFTER</strong> the bullet left the terrorist's rifle! Also Biran
predicted how the new era of "peace" would eliminate the need for an IDF presence in the Jordan
Valley even while Arafat was blowing up buses in <em>Yerushalayim</em> while he was speaking!
For his fealty to the so-called "peace process" (and concomitant lack of concern for the lives
of his soldiers), the Oslo government subsequently rewarded Biran by appointing him as Director
General of the Ministry Defense, and later as chairman of government controlled corporations,
i.e. <em>Israel Oil Refineries</em>, <em>Bezeq</em>, and <em>Yes</em>. Unfortunately after 30
years of the fake peace rigidly enforced by a fake legal system that ignored the associated
massive corruption required to make it work, <em>HaShem</em> overwhelmed the Jewish People with
the Oct. 7 massacres, which immediately woke up the vast majority of Israeli Jews from their
stupor. I call this "baseball bat to the head" therapy. According to ancient Jewish tradition
already stemming from the time of the Egyptian bondage, nothing happens to the Jewish People,
whether good or bad, that is not dictated by <em>HaShem</em> - see <a
href="https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0115.htm">Gen. 15:13</a>.</li>

<li>2023 Jerusalem: Rescued an extremely bright autistic teen from being declared truant and
forcibly sent to an institution for emotional retards due to malicious negligence by the
Ministry of Education.</li>
<li>2016-19 Jerusalem: Rescued 3 young children at family court from foster care when the
Ministry of Social Services maliciously and falsely accused the father (my wife's relative) of
being a pedophile when in fact I showed that his young daughter was serially molested in
locked-down institutions run by Social Services: Even though we eventually won our case which is
highly unusual when social services declares the father to be a pedophile, the most depressing
element was that the judge presiding over this trial became aware that the senior social
services youth officer was committing perjury, and that the court appointed legal guardian of
the children was aware of this perjury yet remained silent, yet the judge never criminally
sanctioned his "colleagues" with whom he worked for many years in the family court system. The
deputy legal advisor for the ministry refused to get involved in this case. And our expensive
attorney who initially promised that he would advocate that they be charged with contempt and
perjury, eventually backed down by saying that we should extremely grateful for the
outcome.</li>
<li>1977 Toronto: While a student in an MBA program, led the battle for <a
href="https://neon.energy/marginal-pricing">marginal cost pricing for electricity</a> in the
Province of Ontario, in the face of strident corporate opposition by huge electricity consumers
who smelted metal who advocated hidden subsidies with surreptitious government backing: I lost
my case, but still the <a href="https://oeb.ca">Ontario Energy Board</a>, where the hearing took
place, awarded me costs. I published an op-ed in Canada's then newspaper of record <a
href="https://www.theglobeandmail.com/">The Globe and Mail</a>. Most important, this hearing was
a God-given life changing experience that taught me how a single individual could successfully
stand up to corporate and government corruption, as can be seen by my subsequent experience
throughout my life.</li>

href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a> blurring filters (e.g. Gaussian, clothify, and oilify)
along with a prominent distorted visible email address watermark. This digital "camouflage" will
defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson
has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1)
Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be digitally
compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">two factor authentication
(2FA)</a>. The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying
my photo while attempting to associate it with any other person besides me. Similarly if a site
were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association with
them then it would be trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to challenge the
site by asking me for a verification email. And it would be interesting to consider adding an <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EURion_constellation">Eurion</a> currency watermark that
would fool Photoshop software along with high quality printers and scanners into believing that
the watermarked photo is a banknote in order to prevent it from being manipulated or printed.
The general field of obscuring personal information is referred to as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De-identification">de-identification</a>. There is an
Israeli company, <a href="https://www.d-id.com">D-ID</a>, that (formerly?) built a product that
was able to obscure high quality images without using any blurring filters which could not be
used in automated face verification scanners!<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back"
