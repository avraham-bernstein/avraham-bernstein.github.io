## Footnotes

[^secure]: __Secure Photo:__ This secure photo was built using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) blurring filters (e.g. Gaussian, clothify, and oilify) along with a prominent distorted visible email address watermark. This digital "camouflage" will defeat almost all face matching algorithms - in spite of the fact that my 3 year old grandson has no problem identifying me from this photo. It protects my privacy in two ways. (1) Harvesting it from the Internet, and adding it to a database of photos that will be digitally compared with CCTV surveillance photos will not work. (2) The photo has built-in [two factor authentication (2FA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). The prominent email address watermark prevents a web site from maliciously displaying my photo while attempting to associate it with any other person besides me. Similarly if a site were to maliciously display my photo without my permission in order to imply my association with them then it would be trivial for anyone who may be suspicious of their claim to challenge the site by asking me for a verification email.
