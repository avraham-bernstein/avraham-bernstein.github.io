	1. Torah & _Yisrael_:
		* My _Aliyah_, i.e. immigration to _Eretz Yisrael_.
		* The scientific evidence for divine creation.
		* The reason why [HaShem](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/) chose the Jews, along with _His_ primary directive to the Jewish People [to keep the ways of _HaShem_, to execute righteousness and justice (Gen. 18:19)](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm). In our time the world is witnessing (1) the fulfillment of this directive when the Jewish People stand alone in the world to rise up like a lioness to devour evil, and (2) the utter nonsense of the _Abrahamic_ "supercessionist" (aka replacement) theologies.            
		* Wars against Hamas and Iranian Islamofascist barbarians.
		* Desecration of [Hashem's](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/) name:
			1. The Oct. 7 ["rave" dancers under a statue of Budda](https://www.catholicsforisrael.com/images/stories/nova_buddha.webp) while the majority of believing Jews [danced in front of Torah scrolls on _Simchat Torah_](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-825795).
			2. [Hareidi](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haredim-charedim/) draft evasion during an existential war.
			3. So-called "pride" "lgbtq+" marches in the streets of _Yerushalayim_.
		* The massive uptick in so-called "progressive" antisemitism in the Western world. We will soon see the fulfillment of the prophecy [blessed be those who bless _Yisrael_, and cursed be those who  curse _Yisrael_ (Num. 24:9)](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0424.htm).
		* The Oslo so-called "peace process" fiasco. Oslo was not a "noble experiment" that "just happened" to fail. The primary instigators, _Shimon Peres_ and _Yossi Beilin_, intentionally designed it to fail!
		* 1995-96: My successful challenge of the IDF's illegal rules of engagement at the Supreme Court during the height of the Oslo lunacy.
		* 1993-95: My experience as an anti-Oslo spy.
		* Israel's "deep state" [juristocracy](https://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/juristocracy-from-the-rule-of-law/).
		* The "Startup Nation".
		* ...
	2. Computer Science:
		* [obfuscation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obfuscation_(software)) anti-reverse engineering
		* cybersecurity
		* [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AST) [source code refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) using Python [Beautiful Soup](https://beautiful-soup-4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and XML
		* [domain specific languages (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
		* modern [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) programming
		* [Misra C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C)
		* [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/)
		* [PyExpander](https://pyexpander.sourceforge.io/)
		* [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell))
		* [Ubuntu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu)
		* virtual machines and [light weight containers (lxc)](https://dev.to/damilola_oladele/get-started-with-lxc-explained-with-installation-guide-4efj)
		* [Xfce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce)
		* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
		* [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
		* a curriculum for a new computer science student
		* my [algorithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) inventions:
			1. an extremely efficient `2^N` sized hash table that can grow without rehashing
			2. novel and efficient _Hamming Weight_-like calculation, i.e. that maps a number in the range \[`0,(2^N)-1`\] to the range \[`0,N`\], via the use of DFTs that generates a nearly uniform probability distribution that makes it useful as a cryptographic primitive
			3. highly efficient (i.e. via register operations) _invertible_ pseudo-random key wrapper primitive that maps a `2^N` bit number to a `2^(2N)` bit number
			4. bioinformatics PCR trivial and accurate "systematic" noise reduction calculation
			5. bioinformatics PCR highly accurate "Ct" calculation using AI techniques (i.e. without the use of functional analysis) that generally works even when encountering "inhibition"
			6. ...
		* ...
	3. Accessibility & Special Education:
		* My invention enabling the blind to sonically "see"/understand maps and mathematical functions by using a standard web browser and a consumer grade graphics tablet.
		* My invention of a generic _dyslexic_ friendly font.
		* How I taught kinesiological multiplication.
		* How I taught a second grader advanced mathematics in 30 min., i.e. exponents and binary arithmetic.
		* ...
	4. Music Composition Software
	5. Health & Exercise:
		* My 5 min. course to teach deep meditation just by using a clock with a second hand.
		* ...
	6. Community Service:
		* 2023 Jerusalem: Rescued an extremely bright autistic teen from being declared truant and forcibly sent to an institution for emotional retards due to malicious negligence by the Ministry of Education.
		* 2016-19 Jerusalem: Rescued 3 young children at family court from foster care when the Ministry of Social Services maliciously and falsely accused the father of being a pedophile when in fact his young daughter was serially molested in locked-down institutions run by Social Services.
		* 1977 Toronto: While a student in an MBA program led the battle for [marginal cost pricing for electricity](https://neon.energy/marginal-pricing) in the Province of Ontario, in the face of strident corporate opposition by huge electricity consumers who smelted metal who advocated hidden subsidies with surreptitious government backing.
