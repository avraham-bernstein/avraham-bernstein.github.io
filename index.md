	1. _Torah_ & _Yisrael_:
		* My _Aliyah_, i.e. immigration to _Eretz Yisrael_.
		* The scientific evidence for divine creation, according to the [Ramban's (c. 1250 CE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides) commentary on the first two chapters of the book of [Genesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Genesis), [Gerald Schroeder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Schroeder), and [Nathan Aviezer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Aviezer).
		* The reason why [HaShem](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/) chose the Jews, along with _His_ primary directive to the Jewish People [to keep the ways of _HaShem_, to execute righteousness and justice (Gen. 18:19)](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0118.htm). In our time (i.e. 2025) the world is witnessing (1) the fulfillment of this directive when the Jewish People stand alone in the world to rise up like a lioness to devour evil, and (2) the moral bankruptcy of the _Abrahamic_ "supercessionist" (aka replacement) theologies. The supercessionists have a highly flawed understanding of "ethical monotheism". Islam, while being monotheistic, worships [A God Who Hates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_God_Who_Hates). They openly admit that their God approves murder, pillaging, piracy, and slavery. Christianity, with highly suspect monotheistic credentials (i.e. their belief in the Trinity), [fundamentally cannot accept that ethical behavior requires adherence to God's laws](https://biblehub.com/topical/t/the_danger_of_legalism.htm), and cannot accept that evil often requires force to be eradicated.       
		* Wars against Hamas and Iranian Islamofascist barbarians.
		* Desecration of [Hashem's](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/hashem/) name:
			1. The Oct. 7 ["rave" dancers under a statue of Budda](https://www.catholicsforisrael.com/images/stories/nova_buddha.webp) while the majority of believing Jews [danced in front of Torah scrolls on _Simchat Torah_](https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-825795).
			2. [Hareidi](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/haredim-charedim/) draft evasion during an existential war. Their behavior is indefensible. Their excuses are nonsensical. I pray that one day soon _HaShem_ will publicly call their leadership to account for their disgusting behavior.
			3. So-called "pride" "LGBTQ+" marches in the streets of _Yerushalayim_: About 3400 years ago, _Hashem_ revealed the _Torah_ to the Jewish People at Mount Sinai 7 weeks after _HaShem_ miraculously liberated them from hundreds of years of Egyptian bondage. The revelation was an extraordinary event. _Hashem_ instructed the Jews to uphold a new ethical legal system that reflected that Man was created in the image of God. It was a radical revolutionary concept for the ancient world that still required thousands of years for Man, at least in the Western world, to subsequently digest. Among other things, the _Torah_ forbids deviant sexual behavior, i.e. adultery, incest, beastiality, and __homosexuality__. People who proudly display such deviancy, even the few who have _bona fide_ psychological or physical urges, are spitting in _HaShem's_ face - regardless of the current fad of political correctness. Unfortunately in the State of Israel, in the name of "freedom of expression", the so-called "legal system" encourages such behavior even though it is reprehensible to the vast majority of the population. These so-called "judges" would never allow anyone to publicly defecate on the Israeli flag on Independence Day, but they have no qualms allowing someone to defecate on the _Torah_.
		* The massive uptick in so-called "progressive" antisemitism in the Western world. I pray that we will soon see the fulfillment of the prophecy [blessed be those who bless _Yisrael_, and cursed be those who  curse _Yisrael_ (Num. 24:9)](https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0424.htm).
		* The Oslo so-called "peace process" fiasco. Oslo was not a "noble experiment" that "just happened" to fail. The primary perpetrators, _Shimon Peres_ and _Yossi Beilin_, __intentionally designed it to fail!__ It must never be forgotten that Oslo enabled the so-called Gaza "Disengagement" which paved the way for the _Hamas_ barbarians to rule Gaza.
		* 1995-96: My __successful__ challenge of the IDF's illegal rules of engagement at the Supreme Court during the height of the Oslo lunacy. An IDF general, i.e. the _Aluf Pikud HaMerkaz_, ordered me, in front of other soldiers, to refrain from preemptively defending myself when a PA terrorist aimed his rifle at me (or at other soldiers or at civilians) until __AFTER__ the bullet left the terrorist's rifle! Also the general predicted how the new era of "peace" would eliminate the need for an IDF presence in the Jordan Valley even while Arafat was blowing up buses in the cities of Israel! For his fealty to the so-called "peace process", Biran was subsequently rewarded with being appointed as Director General of the Ministry Defense, and later as chairman of government controlled corporations, i.e. _Israel Oil Refineries_, _Bezeq_, and _Yes_.
		* 1993-95: My experience as an anti-Oslo spy.
		* Israel's "deep state" [juristocracy](https://valdaiclub.com/a/highlights/juristocracy-from-the-rule-of-law/).
		* The "Startup Nation".

		* a curriculum for a new computer science student
		* my [algorithmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) inventions:
			1. an extremely efficient `2^N` sized [hash table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table) that can grow without rehashing or moving the data associated with the hash key that is stored in the table
			2. novel and efficient [Hamming Weight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)-__like__ calculation, i.e. that maps a number in the range \[`0,(2^N)-1`\] to the range \[`0,N`\], via the use of a [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) that generates a nearly uniform probability distribution that makes it useful as a cryptographic primitive
			3. highly efficient (i.e. via register operations) _invertible_ pseudo-random key wrapper primitive that maps a `2^N` bit number to a `2^(2N)` bit number
			4. bioinformatics [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) trivial and accurate "systematic" noise reduction calculation
			5. bioinformatics [PCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction) highly accurate [Ct](https://torontech.com/what-is-ct-value-in-real-time-pcr/) calculation using AI techniques (i.e. without the use of functional analysis) that generally works even when encountering [inhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymerase_chain_reaction_inhibitors)

	3. Accessibility & Special Education:
		* My invention enabling the blind to sonically "see"/understand maps and mathematical functions by using a standard web browser and a consumer grade graphics tablet.
		* My invention of a generic [dyslexic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyslexia) friendly font, by mimicking the concept that computer vision algorithms use to correctly identify a [QR code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code), regardless of its physical orientation.
		* How I taught kinesiological multiplication to my grandson using floor tiles and masking tape.
		* How I taught a second grader advanced mathematics in 30 min., i.e. exponents and binary arithmetic.
		* Teaching [rational trigonometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Proportions:_Rational_Trigonometry_to_Universal_Geometry) based upon the system that the ancient [Akkadians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire) invented about 4000 years ago.
		* ...
	4. Music Composition Software
	5. Health & Exercise:
		* My 5 min. course to teach deep meditation just by using a clock with a second hand.
		* ...
	6. Community Service:
		* 2023 Jerusalem: Rescued an extremely bright autistic teen from being declared truant and forcibly sent to an institution for emotional retards due to malicious negligence by the Ministry of Education.
		* 2016-19 Jerusalem: Rescued 3 young children at family court from foster care when the Ministry of Social Services maliciously and falsely accused the father (my wife's relative) of being a pedophile when in fact I showed that his young daughter was serially molested in locked-down institutions run by Social Services. Even though we eventually won our case which is highly unusual when social services declares the father to be a pedophile, the most depressing element was that the senior judge presiding over this trial became aware that the senior social services youth officer was committing perjury, and that the court appointed legal guardian of the children was aware of this perjury yet remained silent, yet the judge never criminally sanctioned his "colleagues" with whom he worked for many years in the family court system. The deputy legal advisor for the ministry refused to get involved in this case. And our expensive attorney who initially promised that he would advocate that they be charged with contempt and perjury, eventually backed down by saying that we should extremely grateful for the outcome.
		* 1977 Toronto: While a student in an MBA program, led the battle for [marginal cost pricing for electricity](https://neon.energy/marginal-pricing) in the Province of Ontario, in the face of strident corporate opposition by huge electricity consumers who smelted metal who advocated hidden subsidies with surreptitious government backing. The [Ontario Energy Board](https://oeb.ca), where the hearing took place, awarded me costs. I published an op-ed in Canada's then newspaper of record [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/).  Most important, this hearing was a God-given life changing experience that showed me how a single individual could successfully stand up to corporate and government corruption, as can be seen by my subsequent experience throughout my life.
