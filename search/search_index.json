Many links are still broken.</p> <p>I made Aliyah in 1983 when my wife and I were recently married, and I was just beginning my professional career.  Now we have 4 children and many grandchildren - all of whom live in Eretz Yisrael (English: the Land of Israel). Previously we lived in Canada and the US.  Since we arrived in Eretz Yisrael, we have lived in Yerushalayim (English: Jerusalem) to this day (2025). </p> <p>My profession is a computer scientist. I am still actively inventing new algorithms in a wide range of application domains. See my CV. My very simple home page provides contact information, and is a guide to the site.</p> <p>The subject matter that I cover in my documents site is both professional and personal. I hope that many readers will find it useful and interesting. When the site is more mature, I will add a \u201ctalkback\u201d feature.</p> <p>The personal stuff covers matters of \u201creligion and politics\u201d that admittedly may not be to the taste of some readers - so they should skip that stuff! It should be intuitively obvious that if someone picks himself up from the Goldene Medina leaving nearly all of his family behind at the very beginning of what ought to be a lucrative professional career, but instead immigrates to Eretz Yisrael, which at that time was barely out of third world \u201cdiapers\u201d,  then he undoubtedly has strong opinions on \u201creligion and politics\u201d. Today (2025), Israel is very much a first world nation, aka the Start-up Nation, at the forefront of science and technology, and at the forefront of morality in the world war against Islamofascism.</p> <p>Last Update: 2025-03-20</p>"},{"location":"cs/dsl/","title":"Domain Specific Languages (DSL)","text":"<p>TBD</p>"},{"location":"israel/intro/","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>TBD</p>"}]}
